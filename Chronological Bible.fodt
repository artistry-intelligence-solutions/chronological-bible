   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Introduction</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">The Bible is a collection of prophetically inspired writings and historical accounts from spiritual leaders <text:span text:style-name="T26">of their age</text:span>. It is <text:span text:style-name="T26">arguably</text:span> the most historically, <text:span text:style-name="T26">politically</text:span> and <text:span text:style-name="T26">especially </text:span>theologically significant work of modern literature.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21">Unfortunately the integrity of <text:span text:style-name="T26">the </text:span>Bible as a collection of historical accounts, prophetically inspired or no has been at the mercy <text:span text:style-name="T26">and</text:span> whims of those in power for many centuries. Many modern day English bible versions are constantly revised in the endless pursuit of theological integrity with verses being omitted at the fancy of the publishers. Historically James 1<text:span text:style-name="T25">st</text:span> of the Stewart’s rearranged the Bible from being a chronological account to a theological study. One which was studied in dark secluded rooms away from the public by the ’learned’ and the ’wise’. <text:span text:style-name="T26">Today it is called the King James Bible and the crown still receive royalties every time one is purchased.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">An emerging <text:span text:style-name="T26">group of biblical </text:span>scholars believe that many spiritual secrets have been omitted as a result of this <text:span text:style-name="T26">constant revision</text:span> and often to the detriment of the spiritually faithful. <text:span text:style-name="T26">To quote the King James Bible, “my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge”</text:span>. This has resulted in the modern day church <text:span text:style-name="T26">as a whole</text:span> being a far cry from what it started out as in the days St. Peter and the disciples, as seen in the published Acts of the Epistles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">Historically, theological differences in the interpretation of the word have often resulted in more than just heated discussions over a dinner table, but civil war and even blood shed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">This work seeks to amass traditional Jewish teachings from the Talmud, the Midrash and <text:span text:style-name="T26">the</text:span> cornerstone historical <text:span text:style-name="T26">accord</text:span> <text:s/>the Dead Sea Scrolls into one concise chronological work for the benefit of those in pursuit of the truth. <text:span text:style-name="T26">After which their own spiritual compass shall advise them as to the</text:span> integrity of these writings.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P22">This is a massive collation of the Haggada--the traditions which have grown up surrounding the Biblical narrative. These stories and bits of layered detail are scattered throughout the Talmud and the Midrash, and other sources, including oral. In the 19th century Ginzberg undertook the task of arranging the Haggada into chronological order, and this series of volumes was the result.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P22">In the beginning, two thousand years before the heaven and the earth, seven things were created: the Torah written with black fire on white fire, and lying in the lap of God; the Divine Throne, erected in the heaven which later was over the heads of the Hayyot; Paradise on the right side of God, Hell on the left side; the Celestial Sanctuary directly in front of God, having a jewel on its altar graven with the Name of the Messiah, and a Voice that cries aloud, &quot;Return, ye children of men.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">When God resolved upon the creation of the world, He took counsel with the Torah. Her advice was this: &quot;O Lord, a king without an army and without courtiers and attendants hardly deserves the name of king, for none is nigh to express the homage due to him.&quot; The answer pleased God exceedingly. Thus did He teach all earthly kings, by His Divine example, to undertake naught without first consulting advisers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">The advice of the Torah was given with some reservations. She was skeptical about the value of an earthly world, on account of the sinfulness of men, who would be sure to disregard her precepts. But God dispelled her doubts. He told her, that repentance had been created long before, and sinners would have the opportunity of mending their ways. Besides, the Temple service would be invested with atoning power, and Paradise and hell were intended to do duty as reward and punishment. Finally, the Messiah was appointed to bring salvation, which would put an end to all sinfulness.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:soft-page-break/>Nor is this world inhabited by man the first of things earthly created by God. He made several worlds before ours, but He destroyed them all, because He was pleased with none until He created ours. But even this last world would have had no permanence, if God had executed His original plan of ruling it according to the principle of strict justice. It was only when He saw that justice by itself would undermine the world that He associated mercy with justice, and made them to rule jointly. Thus, from the beginning of all things prevailed Divine goodness, without which nothing could have continued to exist. If not for it, the myriads of evil spirits had soon put an end to the generations of men. But the goodness of God has ordained, that in every Nisan (the first month of the year according to biblical reckoning and the seventh month of the civil year, usually falling within March and April), at the time of the spring equinox, the seraphim shall approach the world of spirits, and intimidate them so that they fear to do harm to men. Again, if God in His goodness had not given protection to the weak, the tame animals would have been extirpated long ago by the wild animals. In Tammuz (4th month of the ecclesiastical year in the Jewish calendar), at the time of the summer solstice, when the strength of behemot is at its height, he roars so loud that all the animals hear it, and for a whole year they are affrighted and timid, and their acts become less ferocious than their nature is. Again, in Tishri (the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year), at the time of the autumnal equinox, the great bird ziz flaps his wings and utters his cry, so that the birds of prey, the eagles and the vultures, blench, and they fear to swoop down upon the others and annihilate them in their greed. And, again, were it not for the goodness of God, the vast number of big fish had quickly put an end to the little ones. But at the time of the winter solstice, in the month of Tebet (10th month of the ecclesiastical year in the Jewish calendar), the sea grows restless, for then leviathan spouts up water, and the big fish become uneasy. They restrain their appetite, and the little ones escape their rapacity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">Finally, the goodness of God manifests itself in the preservation of His people Israel. It could not have survived the enmity of the Gentiles, if God had not appointed protectors for it, the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Whenever Israel disobeys God, and is accused of misdemeanors by the angels of the other nations, he is defended by his designated guardians, with such good result that the other angels conceive <text:soft-page-break/>fear of them. Once the angels of the other nations are terrified, the nations themselves venture not to carry out their wicked designs against Israel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">That the goodness of God may rule on earth as in heaven, the Angels of Destruction are assigned a place at the far end of the heavens, from which they may never stir, while the Angels of Mercy encircle the Throne of God, at His behest.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P58" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_r503nmtyw3ew"/>Haggada - The Alphabet</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">When God was about to create the world by His word, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet descended from the terrible and august crown of God whereon they were engraved with a pen of flaming fire. They stood round about God, and one after the other spake and entreated, &quot;Create the world through me! The first to step forward was the letter Taw. It said: &quot;O Lord of the world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world through me, seeing that it is through me that Thou wilt give the Torah to Israel by the hand of Moses, as it is written, &apos;Moses commanded us the Torah.&apos; &quot; The Holy One, blessed be He, made reply, and said, &quot;No!&quot; Taw asked, &quot;Why not?&quot; and God answered: &quot;Because in days to come I shall place thee as a sign of death upon the foreheads of men.&quot; As soon as Taw heard these words issue from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, it retired from His presence disappointed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Shin then stepped forward, and pleaded: &quot;O Lord of the world, create Thy world through me: seeing that Thine own name Shaddai begins with me.&quot; Unfortunately, it is also the first letter of Shaw, lie, and of Sheker, falsehood, and that incapacitated it. Resh had no better luck. It was pointed out that it was the initial letter of Ra&apos;, wicked, and Rasha&apos; evil, and after that the distinction it enjoys of being the first letter in the Name of God, Rahum, the Merciful, counted for naught. The Kof was rejected, because Kelalah, curse, outweighs the advantage of being the first in Kadosh, the Holy One. In vain did Zadde call attention to Zaddik, the Righteous One; there was Zarot, the misfortunes of Israel, to testify against it. Pe had Podeh, redeemer, to its credit, but Pesha: transgression, reflected dishonor upon it. &apos;Ain was declared unfit, because, though it begins &apos;Anawah, humility, it performs the same service for &apos;Erwah, immorality. Samek said: &quot;O Lord, may it be Thy will to begin the creation with me, for Thou art called Samek, after me, the Upholder of all that fall.&quot; But God said: &quot;Thou art </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">needed in the place in which thou art; thou must continue to uphold all that fall.&quot; Nun introduces Ner, &quot;the lamp of the Lord,&quot; which is &quot;the spirit of men,&quot; but it also introduces Ner, &quot;the lamp of the wicked,&quot; which will be put out by God. Mem starts Melek, king, one of the titles of God. As it is the first letter of Mehumah, confusion, as well, it had no chance of accomplishing its desire. The claim of Lamed bore its refutation within itself. It advanced the argument that it was the first letter of Luhot, the celestial tables for the Ten Commandments; it forgot that the tables were shivered in pieces by Moses. Kaf was sure of victory Kisseh, the throne of God, Kabod, His honor, and Keter, His crown, all begin with it. God had to remind it that He would smite together His hands, Kaf, in despair over the misfortunes of Israel. Yod at first sight seemed the appropriate letter for the beginning of creation, on account of its association with Yah, God, if only Yezer ha-Ra&apos; the evil inclination, had not happened to begin with it, too. Tet is identified with Tob, the good. However, the truly good is not in this world; it belongs to the world to come. Het is the first letter of Hanun, the Gracious One; but this advantage is offset by its place in the word for sin, Hattat. Zain suggests Zakor, remembrance, but it is itself the word for weapon, the doer of mischief. Waw and He compose the Ineffable Name of God; they are therefore too exalted to be pressed into the service of the mundane world. If Dalet Wad stood only for Dabar, the Divine Word, it would have been used, but it stands also for Din, justice, and under the rule of law without love the world would have fallen to ruin. Finally, in spite of reminding one of Gadol, great, Gimel would not do, because Gemul, retribution, starts with it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">After the claims of all these letters had been disposed of, Bet stepped before the Holy One, blessed be He, and pleaded before Him: &quot;O Lord of the world! May it be Thy will to create Thy world through me, seeing that all the dwellers in the world give praise daily unto Thee through me, as it is said, &apos;Blessed be the Lord forever. Amen, and Amen.&apos; &quot; The Holy One, blessed be He, at once granted the petition of Bet. He said, &quot;Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&quot; And He created His world through Bet, as it is said, &quot;Bereshit God created the heaven and the earth.&quot; The only letter that had refrained from urging its claims was the modest Alef, and God rewarded it later for its humility by giving it the first place in the Decalogue.</text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="P59" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_4bsmp9gzj37x"/>Genesis 1</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was unformed and void, darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water. 3 Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 <text:soft-page-break/>God saw that the light was good, and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. So there was evening, and there was morning, one day.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_6x7vt55s86wr"/>Haggada - The First Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On the first day of creation God produced ten things: the heavens and the earth, Tohu and Bohu, light and darkness, wind and water, the duration of the day and the duration of the night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Though the heavens and the earth consist of entirely different elements, they were yet created as a unit, &quot;like the pot and its cover.&quot; The heavens were fashioned from the light of God&apos;s garment, and the earth from the snow under the Divine Throne. Tohu is a green band which encompasses the whole world, and dispenses darkness, and Bohu consists of stones in the abyss, the producers of the waters. The light created at the very beginning is not the same as the light emitted by the sun, the moon, and the stars, which appeared only on the fourth day. The light of the first day was of a sort that would have enabled man to see the world at a glance from one end to the other. Anticipating the wickedness of the sinful generations of the deluge and the Tower of Babel, who were unworthy to enjoy the blessing of such light, God concealed it, but in the world to come it will appear to the pious in all its pristine glory.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Several heavens were created, seven in fact, each to serve a purpose of its own. The first, the one visible to man, has no function except that of covering up the light during the night time; therefore it disappears every morning. The planets are fastened to the second of the heavens; in the third the manna is made for the pious in the hereafter; the fourth contains the celestial Jerusalem together with the Temple, in which Michael ministers as high priest, and offers the souls of the pious as sacrifices. In the fifth heaven, the angel hosts reside, and sing the praise of God, though only during the night, for by day it is the task of Israel on earth to give glory to God on high. The sixth heaven is an uncanny spot; there originate most of the trials and visitations ordained for the earth and its inhabitants. Snow lies heaped up there and hail; there are lofts full of noxious dew, magazines stocked with storms, and cellars holding reserves of smoke. Doors of fire separate these celestial chambers, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">which are under the supervision of the archangel Metatron. Their pernicious contents defiled the heavens until David&apos;s time. The pious king prayed God to purge His exalted dwelling of whatever was pregnant with evil; it was not becoming that such things should exist near the Merciful One. Only then they were removed to the earth.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The seventh heaven, on the other hand, contains naught but what is good and beautiful: right, justice, and mercy, the storehouses of life, peace, and blessing, the souls of the pious, the souls and spirits of unborn generations, the dew with which God will revive the dead on the resurrection day, and, above all, the Divine Throne, surrounded by the seraphim, the ofanim, the holy Hayyot, and the ministering angels.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Corresponding to the seven heavens, God created seven earths, each separated from the next by five layers. Over the lowest earth, the seventh, called Erez, lie in succession the abyss, the Tohu, the Bohu, a sea, and waters. Then the sixth earth is reached, the Adamah, the scene of the magnificence of God. In the same way the Adamah is separated from the fifth earth, the Arka, which contains Gehenna, and Sha&apos;are Mawet, and Sha&apos;are Zalmawet, and Beer Shahat, and Tit ha-Yawen, and Abaddon, and Sheol, and there the souls of the wicked are guarded by the Angels of Destruction. In the same way Arka is followed by Harabah, the dry, the place of brooks and streams in spite of its name, as the next, called Yabbashah, the mainland, contains the rivers and the springs. Tebel, the second earth, is the first mainland inhabited by living creatures, three hundred and sixty-five species, all essentially different from those of our own earth. Some have human heads set on the body of a lion, or a serpent, or an ox; others have human bodies topped by the head of one of these animals. Besides, Tebel is inhabited by human beings with two heads and four hands and feet, in fact with all their organs doubled excepting only the trunk. It happens sometimes that the parts of these double persons quarrel with each other, especially while eating and drinking, when each claims the best and largest portions for himself. This species of mankind is distinguished for great piety, another difference between it and the inhabitants of our earth</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Our own earth is called Heled, and, like the others, it is separated from the Tebel by an abyss, the Tohu, the Bohu, a sea, and waters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Thus one earth rises above the other, from the first to the seventh, and over the seventh earth the heavens are vaulted, from the first to the seventh, the last of them attached to the arm of God. The seven heavens form a unity, the seven kinds of earth form a unity, and the heavens and the earth together also form a unity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When God made our present heavens and our present earth, &quot;the new heavens and the new earth&quot; were also brought forth, yea, and the hundred and ninety-six thousand worlds which God created unto His Own glory.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It takes five hundred years to walk from the earth to the heavens, and from one end of a heaven to the other, and also from one heaven to the next, and it takes the same length of time to travel from the east to the west, or from the south to the north. Of all this vast world only one-third is inhabited, the other two-thirds being equally divided between water and waste desert land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Beyond the inhabited parts to the east is Paradise with its seven divisions, each assigned to the pious of a certain degree. The ocean is situated to the west, and it is dotted with islands upon islands, inhabited by many different peoples. Beyond it, in turn, are the boundless steppes full of serpents and scorpions, and destitute of every sort of vegetation, whether herbs or trees. To the north are the supplies of hell-fire, of snow, hail, smoke, ice, darkness, and windstorms, and in that vicinity sojourn all sorts of devils, demons, and malign spirits. Their dwelling-place is a great stretch of land, it would take five hundred years to traverse it. Beyond lies hell. To the south is the chamber containing reserves of fire, the cave of smoke, and the forge of blasts and hurricanes. Thus it comes that the wind blowing from the south brings heat and sultriness to the earth. Were it not for the angel Ben Nez, the Winged, who keeps the south wind back with his pinions, the world would be consumed. Besides, the fury of its blast is tempered by the north wind, which always appears as moderator, whatever other wind may be blowing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the east, the west, and the south, heaven and earth touch each other, but the north God left unfinished, that any man who announced himself as a god might be set the task of supplying the deficiency, and stand convicted as a pretender.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The construction of the earth was begun at the centre, with the foundation stone of the Temple, the Eben Shetiyah, for the Holy Land is at the central point of the surface of the earth, Jerusalem is at the central point of Palestine, and the Temple is situated at the centre of the Holy City. In the sanctuary itself the Hekal is the centre, and the holy Ark occupies the centre of the Hekal, built on the foundation stone, which thus is at the centre of the earth. Thence issued the first ray of light, piercing to the Holy Land, and from there illuminating the whole earth. The creation of the world, however, could not take place until God had banished the ruler of the dark. &quot;Retire,&quot; God said to him, &quot;for I desire to create the world by means of light.&quot; Only after the light had been fashioned, darkness arose, the light ruling in the sky, the darkness on the earth. The power of God displayed itself not only in the creation of the world of things, but equally in the limitations which He imposed upon each. The heavens and the earth stretched themselves out in length and breadth as though they aspired to infinitude, and it required the word of God to call a halt to their encroachments.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the water; let it divide the water from the water.” 7 God made the dome and divided the water under the dome from the water above the dome; that is how it was, 8 and God called the dome Sky. So there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_lvoi7xnjwrsh"/>Haggada - The Second Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On the second day God brought forth four creations, the firmament, hell, fire, and the angels. The firmament is not the same as the heavens of the first day. It is the crystal stretched forth over the heads of the Hayyot, from which the heavens derive their light, as the earth derives its light from the sun. This firmament saves the earth from being engulfed by the waters of the heavens; it forms the partition between the waters above and the waters below. It was made to crystallize into the solid it is by the heavenly fire, which broke its bounds, and condensed the surface of the firmament. Thus fire made a division between the celestial and the terrestrial at the time of creation, as it did at the revelation on Mount Sinai. The firmament is not more than three fingers thick, nevertheless it divides two such heavy bodies as the waters <text:soft-page-break/>below, which are the foundations for the nether world, and the waters above, which are the foundations for the seven heavens, the Divine Throne, and the abode of the angels.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The separation of the waters into upper and lower waters was the only act of the sort done by God in connection with the work of creation. All other acts were unifying. It therefore caused some difficulties. When God commanded, &quot;Let the waters be gathered together, unto one place, and let the dry land appear,&quot; certain parts refused to obey. They embraced each other all the more closely. In His wrath at the waters, God determined to let the whole of creation resolve itself into chaos again. He summoned the Angel of the Face, and ordered him to destroy the world. The angel opened his eyes wide, and scorching fires and thick clouds rolled forth from them, while he cried out, &quot;He who divides the Red Sea in sunder!&quot;--and the rebellious waters stood. The all, however, was still in danger of destruction. Then began the singer of God&apos;s praises: &quot;O Lord of the world, in days to come Thy creatures will sing praises without end to Thee, they will bless Thee boundlessly, and they will glorify Thee without measure. Thou wilt set Abraham apart from all mankind as Thine own; one of his sons Thou wilt call &apos;My first-born&apos;; and his descendants will take the yoke of Thy kingdom upon themselves. In holiness and purity Thou wilt bestow Thy Torah upon them, with the words, &apos;I am the Lord your God,&apos; whereunto they will make answer, &apos;All that God hath spoken we will do.&apos; And now I beseech Thee, have pity upon Thy world, destroy it not, for if Thou destroyest it, who will fulfil Thy will?&quot; God was pacified; He withdrew the command ordaining the destruction of the world, but the waters He put under the mountains, to remain there forever. The objection of the lower waters to division and Separation was not their only reason for rebelling. The waters had been the first to give praise to God, and when their separation into upper and lower was decreed, the waters above rejoiced, saying, &quot;Blessed are we who are privileged to abide near our Creator and near His Holy Throne.&quot; Jubilating thus, they flew upward, and uttered song and praise to the Creator of the world. Sadness fell upon the waters below. They lamented: &quot;Woe unto us, we have not been found worthy to dwell in the presence of God, and praise Him together with our companions.&quot; Therefore they attempted to rise upward, until God repulsed them, and pressed them under the earth. Yet they were not left unrewarded for their loyalty. <text:soft-page-break/>Whenever the waters above desire to give praise to God, they must first seek permission from the waters below.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The second day of creation was an untoward day in more than the one respect that it introduced a breach where before there had been nothing but unity; for it was the day that saw also the creation of hell. Therefore God could not say of this day as of the others, that He &quot;saw that it was good.&quot; A division may be necessary, but it cannot be called good, and hell surely does not deserve the attribute of good. Hell has seven divisions, one beneath the other. They are called Sheol, Abaddon, Beer Shahat, Tit ha-Yawen, Sha&apos;are Mawet, Sha&apos;are Zalmawet: and Gehenna. It requires three hundred years to traverse the height, or the width, or the depth of each division, and it would take six thousand three hundred years to go over a tract of land equal in extent to the seven divisions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Each of the seven divisions in turn has seven subdivisions, and in each compartment there are seven rivers of fire and seven of hail. The width of each is one thousand ells, its depth one thousand, and its length three hundred, and they flow one from the other, and are supervised by ninety thousand Angels of Destruction. There are, besides, in every compartment seven thousand caves, in every cave there are seven thousand crevices, and in every crevice seven thousand scorpions. Every scorpion has three hundred rings, and in every ring seven thousand pouches of venom, from which flow seven rivers of deadly poison. If a man handles it, he immediately bursts, every limb is torn from his body, his bowels are cleft asunder, and he falls upon his face. There are also five different kinds of fire in hell. One devours and absorbs, another devours and does not absorb, while the third absorbs and does not devour, and there is still another fire, which neither devours nor absorbs, and furthermore a fire which devours fire. There are coals big as mountains, and coals big as hills, and coals as large as the Dead Sea, and coals like huge stones, and there are rivers of pitch and sulphur flowing and seething like live coals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The third creation of the second day was the angel hosts, both the ministering angels and the angels of praise. The reason they had not been called into being on the first day was, lest men believe that the angels assisted God in the creation of the heavens and the earth. The angels that are fashioned from fire have forms of fire, but <text:soft-page-break/>only so long as they remain in heaven. When they descend to earth, to do the bidding of God here below, either they are changed into wind, or they assume the guise of men. There are ten ranks or degrees among the angels.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The most exalted in rank are those surrounding the Divine Throne on all sides, to the right, to the left, in front, and behind, under the leadership of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">All the celestial beings praise God with the words, &quot;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,&quot; but men take precedence of the angels herein. They may not begin their song of praise until the earthly beings have brought their homage to God. Especially Israel is preferred to the angels. When they encircle the Divine Throne in the form of fiery mountains and flaming hills, and attempt to raise their voices in adoration of the Creator, God silences them with the words, &quot;Keep quiet until I have heard the songs, praises, prayers, and sweet melodies of Israel.&quot; Accordingly, the ministering angels and all the other celestial hosts wait until the last tones of Israel&apos;s doxologies rising aloft from earth have died away, and then they proclaim in a loud voice, &quot;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.&quot; When the hour for the glorification of God by the angels draws nigh, the august Divine herald, the angel Sham&apos;iel, steps to the windows of the lowest heaven to hearken to the songs, prayers, and praises that ascend from the synagogues and the houses of learning, and when they are finished, he announces the end to the angels in all the heavens. The ministering angels, those who come in contact with the sublunary world, now repair to their chambers to take their purification bath. They dive into a stream of fire and flame seven times, and three hundred and sixty-five times they examine themselves carefully, to make sure that no taint clings to their bodies. Only then they feel privileged to mount the fiery ladder and join the angels of the seventh heaven, and surround the throne of God with Hashmal and all the holy Hayyot. Adorned with millions of fiery crowns, arrayed in fiery garments, all the angels in unison, in the same words, and with the same melody, intone songs of praise to God.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let dry land appear,” and that is how it was. 10 God called the dry land Earth, the gathering together of the water he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 God said, “Let the earth put forth grass, seed-producing plants, and fruit trees, each yielding its own kind of seed-bearing fruit, on the earth”; and that is how it was. 12 The earth brought forth grass, plants each yielding its own kind of seed, and trees each producing its own kind of seed-bearing fruit; and God saw that it was good. 13 So there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_ze08v9a7l6f9"/>Haggada - The Third Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Up to this time the earth was a plain, and wholly covered with water. Scarcely had the words of God, &quot;Let the waters be gathered together,&quot; made themselves heard, when mountains appeared all over and hills, and the water collected in the deep-lying basins. But the water was recalcitrant, it resisted the order to occupy the lowly spots, and threatened to overflow the earth, until God forced it back into the sea, and encircled the sea with sand. Now, whenever the water is tempted to transgress its bounds, it beholds the sand, and recoils.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The waters did but imitate their chief Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, who rebelled at the creation of the world. God had commanded Rahab to take in the water. But he refused, saying, &quot;I have enough.&quot; The punishment for his disobedience was death. His body rests in the depths of the sea, the water dispelling the foul odor that emanates from it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The main creation of the third day was the realm of plants, the terrestrial plants as well as the plants of Paradise. First of all the cedars of Lebanon and the other great trees were made. In their pride at having been put first, they shot up high in the air. They considered themselves the favored among plants. Then God spake, &quot;I hate arrogance and pride, for I alone am exalted, and none beside,&quot; and He created the iron on the same day, the substance with which trees are felled down. The trees began to weep, and when God asked the reason of their tears, they said: &quot;We cry <text:soft-page-break/>because Thou hast created the iron to uproot us therewith. All the while we had thought ourselves the highest of the earth, and now the iron, our destroyer, has been called into existence.&quot; God replied: &quot;You yourselves will furnish the axe with a handle. Without your assistance the iron will not be able to do aught against you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The command to bear seed after their kind was given to the trees alone. But the various sorts of grass reasoned, that if God had not desired divisions according to classes, He would not have instructed the trees to bear fruit after their kind with the seed thereof in it, especially as trees are inclined of their own accord to divide themselves into species. The grasses therefore reproduced themselves also after their kinds. This prompted the exclamation of the Prince of the World, &quot;Let the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The most important work done on the third day was the creation of Paradise. Two gates of carbuncle form the entrance to Paradise, and sixty myriads of ministering angels keep watch over them. Each of these angels shines with the lustre of the heavens. When the just man appears before the gates, the clothes in which he was buried are taken off him, and the angels array him in seven garments of clouds of glory, and place upon his head two crowns, one of precious stones and pearls, the other of gold of Parvaim, and they put eight myrtles in his hand, and they utter praises before him and say to him, &quot;Go thy way, and eat thy bread with joy.&quot; And they lead him to a place full of rivers, surrounded by eight hundred kinds of roses and myrtles. Each one has a canopy according to his merits, and under it flow four rivers, one of milk, the other of balsam, the third of wine, and the fourth of honey. Every canopy is overgrown by a vine of gold, and thirty pearls hang from it, each of them shining like Venus. Under each canopy there is a table of precious stones and pearls, and sixty angels stand at the head of every just man, saying unto him: &quot;Go and eat with joy of the honey, for thou hast busied thyself with the Torah, and she is sweeter than honey, and drink of the wine preserved in the grape since the six days of creation, for thou hast busied thyself with the Torah, and she is compared to wine.&quot; The least fair of the just is beautiful as Joseph and Rabbi Johanan, and as the grains of a silver pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun. There is no light, &quot;for the light of the righteous is the shining light.&quot; And they undergo four transformations every day, passing through four states. In the first the righteous is changed into a <text:soft-page-break/>child. He enters the division for children, and tastes the joys of childhood. Then he is changed into a youth, and enters the division for the youths, with whom he enjoys the delights of youth. Next he becomes an adult, in the prime of life, and he enters the division of men, and enjoys the pleasures of manhood. Finally, he is changed into an old man. He enters the division for the old, and enjoys the pleasures of age.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">There are eighty myriads of trees in every corner of Paradise, the meanest among them choicer than all the spice trees. In every corner there are sixty myriads of angels singing with sweet voices, and the tree of life stands in the middle and shades the whole of Paradise. It has fifteen thousand tastes, each different from the other, and the perfumes thereof vary likewise. Over it hang seven clouds of glory, and winds blow upon it from all four sides, so that its odor is wafted from one end of the world to the other. Underneath sit the scholars and explain the Torah. Over each of them two canopies are spread, one of stars, the other of sun and moon, and a curtain of clouds of glory separates the one canopy from the other. Beyond Paradise begins Eden, containing three hundred and ten worlds and seven compartments for seven different classes of the pious. In the first are &quot;the martyr victims of the government,&quot; like Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues; in the second those who were drowned; in the third Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples; in the fourth those who were carried off in the cloud of glory; in the fifth the penitents, who occupy a place which even a perfectly pious man cannot obtain; in the sixth are the youths who have not tasted of sin in their lives; in the seventh are those poor who studied Bible and Mishnah, and led a life of self-respecting decency. And God sits in the midst of them and expounds the Torah to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As for the seven divisions of Paradise, each of them is twelve myriads of miles in width and twelve myriads of miles in length. In the first division dwell the proselytes who embraced Judaism of their own free will, not from compulsion. The walls are of glass and the wainscoting of cedar. The prophet Obadiah, himself a proselyte, is the overseer of this first division. The second division is built of silver, and the wainscoting thereof is of cedar. Here dwell those who have repented, and Manasseh, the penitent son of Hezekiah, presides over them. The third division is built of silver and gold. Here dwell Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Israelites who came out of Egypt, and the whole generation that lived in the desert. Also David is there, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">together with all his sons except Absalom, one of them, Chileab, still alive. And all the kings of Judah are there, with the exception of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, who presides in the second division, over the penitents. Moses and Aaron preside over the third division. Here are precious vessels of silver and gold and jewels and canopies and beds and thrones and lamps, of gold, of precious stones, and of pearls, the best of everything there is in heaven. The fourth division is built of beautiful rubies, and its wainscoting is of olive wood. Here dwell the perfect and the steadfast in faith, and their wainscoting is of olive wood, because their lives were bitter as olives to them. The fifth division is built of silver and gold and refined gold, and the finest of gold and glass and bdellium, and through the midst of it flows the river Gihon. The wainscoting is of silver and gold, and a perfume breathes through it more exquisite than the perfume of Lebanon. The coverings of the silver and gold beds are made of purple and blue, woven by Eve, and of scarlet and the hair of goats, woven by angels. Here dwells the Messiah on a palanquin made of the wood of Lebanon, &quot;the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom of gold, the seat of it purple.&quot; With him is Elijah. He takes the head of Messiah, and places it in his bosom, and says to him, &quot;Be quiet, for the end draweth nigh.&quot; On every Monday and Thursday and on Sabbaths and holidays, the Patriarchs come to him, and the twelve sons of Jacob, and Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, and all the kings of Israel and of Judah, and they weep with him and comfort him, and say unto him, &quot;Be quiet and put trust in thy Creator, for the end draweth nigh. &quot;Also Korah and his company, and Dathan, Abiram, and Absalom come to him on every Wednesday, and ask him: &quot;How long before the end comes full of wonders? When wilt thou bring us life again, and from the abysses of the earth lift us?&quot; The Messiah answers them, &quot;Go to your fathers and ask them&quot;; and when they hear this, they are ashamed, and do not ask their fathers.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_xvzi3cps75y9"/>Haggada - The Fourth Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The fourth day of creation produced the sun, the moon, and the stars. These heavenly spheres were not actually fashioned on this day; they were created on the first day, and merely were assigned their places in the heavens on the fourth. At first the sun and the moon enjoyed equal powers and prerogatives. The moon spoke to God, and said: &quot;O Lord, why didst Thou create the world with the letter Bet?&quot; God replied: &quot;That it might be made known unto My creatures that there are two worlds.&quot; The moon: &quot;O Lord: which of the two worlds is the larger, this world or the world to come?&quot; God: &quot;The world to come is the larger.&quot; The moon: &quot;O Lord, Thou didst create two worlds, a greater and a lesser world; Thou didst create the heaven and the earth, the heaven exceeding the earth; Thou didst create fire and water, the water stronger than the fire, because it can quench the fire; and now Thou hast created the sun and the moon, and it is becoming that one of them should be greater than the other.&quot; Then spake God to the moon: &quot;I know well, thou wouldst have me make Thee greater than the sun. As a punishment I decree that thou mayest keep but one-sixtieth of thy light.&quot; The moon made supplication: &quot;Shall I be punished so severely for having spoken a single word?&quot; God relented: &quot;In the future world I will restore thy light, so that thy light may again be as the light of the sun.&quot; The moon was not yet satisfied. &quot;O Lord,&quot; she said, &quot;and the light of the sun, how great will it be in that day?&quot; Then the wrath of God was once more enkindled: &quot;What, thou still plottest against the sun? As thou livest, in the world to come his light shall be sevenfold the light he now sheds.&quot; The Sun runs his course like a bridegroom. He sits upon a throne with a garland on his head. Ninety-six angels accompany him on his daily journey, in relays of eight every hour, two to the left of him, and two to the right, two before Him, and two behind. Strong as he is, he could complete his course from south to north in a single instant, but three hundred and sixty-five angels restrain him by means of as many <text:soft-page-break/>grappling-irons. Every day one looses his hold, and the sun must thus spend three hundred and sixty-five days on his course. The progress of the sun in his circuit is an uninterrupted song of praise to God. And this song alone makes his motion possible. Therefore, when Joshua wanted to bid the sun stand still, he had to command him to be silent. His song of praise hushed, the sun stood still.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sun is double-faced; one face, of fire, is directed toward the earth, and one of hail, toward heaven, to cool off the prodigious heat that streams from the other face, else the earth would catch afire. In winter the sun turns his fiery face upward, and thus the cold is produced. When the sun descends in the west in the evening, he dips down into the ocean and takes a bath, his fire is extinguished, and therefore he dispenses neither light nor warmth during the night. But as soon as he reaches the east in the morning, he laves himself in a stream of flame, which imparts warmth and light to him, and these he sheds over the earth. In the same way the moon and the stars take a bath in a stream of hail before they enter upon their service for the night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the sun and the moon are ready to start upon their round of duties, they appear before God, and beseech him to relieve them of their task, so that they may be spared the sight of sinning mankind. Only upon compulsion they proceed with their daily course. Coming from the presence of God, they are blinded by the radiance in the heavens, and they cannot find their way. God, therefore, shoots off arrows, by the glittering light of which they are guided. It is on account of the sinfulness of man, which the sun is forced to contemplate on his rounds, that he grows weaker as the time of his going down approaches, for sins have a defiling and enfeebling effect, and he drops from the horizon as a sphere of blood, for blood is the sign of corruption. As the sun sets forth on his course in the morning, his wings touch the leaves on the trees of Paradise, and their vibration is communicated to the angels and the holy Hayyot, to the other plants, and also to the trees and plants on earth, and to all the beings on earth and in heaven. It is the signal for them all to cast their eyes upward. As soon as they see the Ineffable Name, which is engraved in the sun, they raise their voices in songs of praise to God. At the same moment a heavenly voice is heard to say, &quot;Woe to the sons of men that consider not the honor of God like unto these creatures whose voices now rise aloft in adoration.&quot; These words, naturally, are not heard by men; as little as they perceive the grating of the sun </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">against the wheel to which all the celestial bodies are attached, although the noise it makes is extraordinarily loud. This friction of the sun and the wheel produces the motes dancing about in the sunbeams. They are the carriers of healing to the sick, the only health-giving creations of the fourth day, on the whole an unfortunate day, especially for children, afflicting them with disease. When God punished the envious moon by diminishing her light and splendor, so that she ceased to be the equal of the sun as she had been originally, she fell, and tiny threads were loosed from her body. These are the stars.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 God said, “Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open dome of the sky.” 21 God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that creeps, so that the water swarmed with all kinds of them, and there was every kind of winged bird; and God saw that it was good. 22 Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, multiply and fill the water of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 23 So there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_dbij7loa8t2h"/>Haggada - The Fifth Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On the fifth day of creation God took fire and water, and out of these two elements He made the fishes of the sea. The animals in the water are much more numerous than those on land. For every species on land, excepting only the weasel, there is a corresponding species in the water, and, besides, there are many found only in the water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The ruler over the sea-animals is leviathan. With all the other fishes he was made on the fifth day. Originally he was created male and female like all the other animals. But when it appeared that a pair of these monsters might annihilate the whole earth with their united strength, God killed the female. So enormous is leviathan that to quench his thirst he needs all the water that flows from the Jordan into the sea. His food consists of the fish which go between his jaws of their own accord. When he is hungry, a hot breath blows from his nostrils, and it makes the waters of the great sea seething hot. Formidable though behemot, the other monster, is, he feels insecure until he is certain that leviathan has satisfied his thirst. The only thing that can keep </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">him in check is the stickleback, a little fish which was created for the purpose, and of which he stands in great awe. But leviathan is more than merely large and strong; he is wonderfully made besides. His fins radiate brilliant light, the very sun is obscured by it, and also his eyes shed such splendor that frequently the sea is illuminated suddenly by it. No wonder that this marvellous beast is the plaything of God, in whom He takes His pastime.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">There is but one thing that makes leviathan repulsive, his foul smell: which is so strong that if it penetrated thither, it would render Paradise itself an impossible abode.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The real purpose of leviathan is to be served up as a dainty to the pious in the world to come. The female was put into brine as soon as she was killed, to be preserved against the time when her flesh will be needed. The male is destined to offer a delectable sight to all beholders before he is consumed. When his last hour arrives, God will summon the angels to enter into combat with the monster. But no sooner will leviathan cast his glance at them than they will flee in fear and dismay from the field of battle. They will return to the charge with swords, but in vain, for his scales can turn back steel like straw. They will be equally unsuccessful when they attempt to kill him by throwing darts and slinging stones; such missiles will rebound without leaving the least impression on his body. Disheartened, the angels will give up the combat, and God will command leviathan and behemot to enter into a duel with each other. The issue will be that both will drop dead, behemot slaughtered by a blow of leviathan&apos;s fins, and leviathan killed by a lash of behemot&apos;s tail. From the skin of leviathan God will construct tents to shelter companies of the pious while they enjoy the dishes made of his flesh. The amount assigned to each of the pious will be in proportion to his deserts, and none will envy or begrudge the other his better share. What is left of leviathan&apos;s skin will be stretched out over Jerusalem as a canopy, and the light streaming from it will illumine the whole world, and what is left of his flesh after the pious have appeased their appetite, will be distributed among the rest of men, to carry on traffic therewith.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>On the same day with the fishes, the birds were created, for these two kinds of animals are closely related to each other. Fish are fashioned out of water, and birds out of marshy ground saturated with water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As leviathan is the king of fishes, so the ziz is appointed to rule over the birds. His name comes from the variety of tastes his flesh has; it tastes like this, zeh, and like that, zeh. The ziz is as monstrous of size as leviathan himself. His ankles rest on the earth, and his head reaches to the very sky.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It once happened that travellers on a vessel noticed a bird. As he stood in the water, it merely covered his feet, and his head knocked against the sky. The onlookers thought the water could not have any depth at that point, and they prepared to take a bath there. A heavenly voice warned them: &quot;Alight not here! Once a carpenter&apos;s axe slipped from his hand at this spot, and it took it seven years to touch bottom.&quot; The bird the travellers saw was none other than the ziz. His wings are so huge that unfurled they darken the sun. They protect the earth against the storms of the south; without their aid the earth would not be able to resist the winds blowing thence. Once an egg of the ziz fell to the ground and broke. The fluid from it flooded sixty cities, and the shock crushed three hundred cedars. Fortunately such accidents do not occur frequently. As a rule the bird lets her eggs slide gently into her nest. This one mishap was due to the fact that the egg was rotten, and the bird cast it away carelessly. The ziz has another name, Renanin, because he is the celestial singer. On account of his relation to the heavenly regions he is also called Sekwi, the seer, and, besides, he is called &quot;son of the nest,&quot; because his fledgling birds break away from the shell without being hatched by the mother bird; they spring directly from the nest, as it were. Like leviathan, so ziz is a delicacy to be served to the pious at the end of time, to compensate them for the privations which abstaining from the unclean fowls imposed upon them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>26 Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, in the likeness of ourselves; and let them rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, the animals, and over all the earth, and over every crawling creature that crawls on the earth.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">27 So God created humankind in his own image;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">in the image of God he created him:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">male and female he created them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">28 God blessed them: God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the air and every living creature that crawls on the earth.” 29 Then God said, “Here! Throughout the whole earth I am giving you as food every seed-bearing plant and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. 30 And to every wild animal, bird in the air and creature crawling on the earth, in which there is a living soul, I am giving as food every kind of green plant.” And that is how it was. 31 God saw everything that he had made, and indeed it was very good. So there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_pvowitkol6wt"/>Haggada - The Sixth Day</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As the fish were formed out of water, and the birds out of boggy earth well mixed with water, so the mammals were formed out of solid earth, and as leviathan is the most notable representative of the fish kind, and ziz of the bird kind, so behemot is the most notable representative of the mammal kind. Behemot matches leviathan in strength, and he had to be prevented, like leviathan, from multiplying and increasing, else the world could not have continued to exist; after God had created him male and female, He at once deprived him of the desire to propagate his kind. He is so monstrous that he requires the produce of a thousand mountains for his daily food. All the water that flows through the bed of the Jordan in a year suffices him exactly for one gulp. It therefore was necessary to give him one stream entirely for his own use, a stream flowing forth from Paradise, called Yubal. Behemot, too, is destined to be served to the pious as an appetizing dainty, but before they enjoy his flesh, they will be permitted to view the mortal combat between leviathan and behemot, as a <text:soft-page-break/>reward for having denied themselves the pleasures of the circus and its gladiatorial contests.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Leviathan, ziz, and behemot are not the only monsters; there are many others, and marvellous ones, like the reem, a giant animal, of which only one couple, male and female, is in existence. Had there been more, the world could hardly have maintained itself against them. The act of copulation occurs but once in seventy years between them, for God has so ordered it that the male and female reem are at opposite ends of the earth, the one in the east, the other in the west. The act of copulation results in the death of the male. He is bitten by the female and dies of the bite. The female becomes pregnant and remains in this state for no less than twelve years. At the end of this long period she gives birth to twins, a male and a female. The year preceding her delivery she is not able to move. She would die of hunger, were it not that her own spittle flowing copiously from her mouth waters and fructifies the earth near her, and causes it to bring forth enough for her maintenance. For a whole year the animal can but roll from side to side, until finally her belly bursts, and the twins issue forth. Their appearance is thus the signal for the death of the mother reem. She makes room for the new generation, which in turn is destined to suffer the same fate as the generation that went before. Immediately after birth, the one goes eastward and the other westward, to meet only after the lapse of seventy years, propagate themselves, and perish. A traveller who once saw a reem one day old described its height to be four parasangs, and the length of its head one parasang and a half. Its horns measure one hundred ells, and their height is a great deal more.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">One of the most remarkable creatures is the &quot;man of the mountain,&quot; Adne Sadeh, or, briefly, Adam. His form is exactly that of a human being, but he is fastened to the ground by means of a navel-string, upon which his life depends. The cord once snapped, he dies. This animal keeps himself alive with what is produced by the soil around about him as far as his tether permits him to crawl. No creature may venture to approach within the radius of his cord, for he seizes and demolishes whatever comes in his reach. To kill him, one may not go near to him, the navel-string must be </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">severed from a distance by means of a dart, and then he dies amid groans and moans. Once upon a time a traveller happened in the region where this animal is found. He overheard his host consult his wife as to what to do to honor their guest, and resolve to serve &quot;our man,&quot; as he said. Thinking he had fallen among cannibals, the stranger ran as fast as his feet could carry him from his entertainer, who sought vainly to restrain him. Afterward, he found out that there had been no intention of regaling him with human flesh, but only with the flesh of the strange animal called &quot;man.&quot; As the &quot;man of the mountain&quot; is fixed to the ground by his navel-string, so the barnacle-goose is grown to a tree by its bill. It is hard to say whether it is an animal and must be slaughtered to be fit for food, or whether it is a plant and no ritual ceremony is necessary before eating it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Among the birds the phoenix is the most wonderful. When Eve gave all the animals some of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the phoenix was the only bird that refused to eat thereof, and he was rewarded with eternal life. When he has lived a thousand years, his body shrinks, and the feathers drop from it, until he is as small as an egg. This is the nucleus of the new bird.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The phoenix is also called &quot;the guardian of the terrestrial sphere.&quot; He runs with the sun on his circuit, and he spreads out his wings and catches up the fiery rays of the sun. If he were not there to intercept them, neither man nor any other animate being would keep alive. On his right wing the following words are inscribed in huge letters, about four thousand stadia high: &quot;Neither the earth produces me, nor the heavens, but only the wings of fire.&quot; His food consists of the manna of heaven and the dew of the earth. His excrement is a worm, whose excrement in turn is the cinnamon used by kings and princes. Enoch, who saw the phoenix birds when he was translated, describes them as flying creatures, wonderful and strange in appearance, with the feet and tails of lions, and the heads of crocodiles; their appearance is of a purple color like the rainbow; their size nine hundred measures. Their wings are like those of angels, each having twelve, and they attend the chariot of the sun and go with him, bringing heat and dew as they are ordered by God. In the morning when the sun starts on his daily course, the phoenixes and the chalkidri sing, and every bird flaps its wings, rejoicing the Giver of light, and they sing a song at the command of the Lord. Among reptiles the salamander and the shamir are the most marvellous. The <text:soft-page-break/>salamander originates from a fire of myrtle wood which has been kept burning for seven years steadily by means of magic arts. Not bigger than a mouse, it yet is invested with peculiar properties. One who smears himself with its blood is invulnerable, and the web woven by it is a talisman against fire. The people who lived at the deluge boasted that, were a fire flood to come, they would protect themselves with the blood of the salamander.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">King Hezekiah owes his life to the salamander. His wicked father, King Ahaz, had delivered him to the fires of Moloch, and he would have been burnt, had his mother not painted him with the blood of the salamander, so that the fire could do him no harm.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The shamir was made at twilight on the sixth day of creation together with other extraordinary things. It is about as large as a barley corn, and it possesses the remarkable property of cutting the hardest of diamonds. For this reason it was used for the stones in the breastplate worn by the high priest. First the names of the twelve tribes were traced with ink on the stones to be set into the breastplate, then the shamir was passed over the lines, and thus they were graven. The wonderful circumstance was that the friction wore no particles from the stones. The shamir was also used for hewing into shape the stones from which the Temple was built, because the law prohibited iron tools to be used for the work in the Temple. The shamir may not be put in an iron vessel for safe-keeping, nor in any metal vessel, it would burst such a receptacle asunder. It is kept wrapped up in a woollen cloth, and this in turn is placed in a lead basket filled with barley bran. The shamir was guarded in Paradise until Solomon needed it. He sent the eagle thither to fetch the worm. With the destruction of the Temple the shamir vanished. A similar fate overtook the tahash, which had been created only that its skin might be used for the Tabernacle. Once the Tabernacle was completed, the tahash disappeared. It had a horn on its forehead, was gaily colored like the turkey-cock, and belonged to the class of clean animals. Among the fishes there are also wonderful creatures, the sea-goats and the dolphins, not to mention leviathan. A sea-faring man once saw a sea-goat on whose horns the words were inscribed: &quot;I am a little sea-animal, yet I traversed three hundred parasangs to offer myself as food to the leviathan.&quot; The dolphins are half man and half fish; they even have sexual intercourse with human beings; therefore <text:soft-page-break/>they are called also &quot;sons of the sea,&quot; for in a sense they represent the human kind in the waters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Though every species in the animal world was created during the last two days of the six of creation, yet many characteristics of certain animals appeared later. Cats and mice, foes now, were friends originally. Their later enmity had a distinct cause. On one occasion the mouse appeared before God and spoke: &quot;I and the cat are partners, but now we have nothing to eat.&quot; The Lord answered: &quot;Thou art intriguing against thy companion, only that thou mayest devour her. As a punishment, she shall devour thee.&quot; Thereupon the mouse: &quot;O Lord of the world, wherein have I done wrong?&quot; God replied: &quot;O thou unclean reptile, thou shouldst have been warned by the example of the moon, who lost a part of her light, because she spake ill of the sun, and what she lost was given to her opponent. The evil intentions thou didst harbor against thy companion shall be punished in the same way. Instead of thy devouring her, she shall devour thee.&quot; The mouse: &quot;O Lord of the world! Shall my whole kind be destroyed?&quot; God: &quot;I will take care that a remnant of thee is spared.&quot; In her rage the mouse bit the cat, and the cat in turn threw herself upon the mouse, and hacked into her with her teeth until she lay dead. Since that moment the mouse stands in such awe of the cat that she does not even attempt to defend herself against her enemy&apos;s attacks, and always keeps herself in hiding. Similarly dogs and cats maintained a friendly relation to each other, and only later on became enemies. A dog and a cat were partners, and they shared with each other whatever they had. It once happened that neither could find anything to eat for three days. Thereupon the dog proposed that they dissolve their partnership. The cat should go to Adam, in whose house there would surely be enough for her to eat, while the dog should seek his fortune elsewhere. Before they separated, they took an oath never to go to the same master. The cat took up her abode with Adam, and she found sufficient mice in his house to satisfy her appetite. Seeing how useful she was in driving away and extirpating mice, Adam treated her most kindly. The dog, on the other hand, saw bad times. The first night after their separation he spent in the cave of the wolf, who had granted him a night&apos;s lodging. At night the dog caught the sound of steps, and he reported it to his host, who bade him repulse the intruders. They were wild animals. Little lacked and the dog would have lost his life. Dismayed, the dog fled from the house of the wolf, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and took refuge with the monkey. But he would not grant him even a single night&apos;s lodging; and the fugitive was forced to appeal to the hospitality of the sheep. Again the dog heard steps in the middle of the night. Obeying the bidding of his host, he arose to chase away the marauders, who turned out to be wolves. The barking of the dog apprised the wolves of the presence of sheep, so that the dog innocently caused the sheep&apos;s death. Now he had lost his last friend. Night after night he begged for shelter, without ever finding a home. Finally, he decided to repair to the house of Adam, who also granted him refuge for one night. When wild animals approached the house under cover of darkness, the dog began to bark, Adam awoke, and with his bow and arrow he drove them away. Recognizing the dog&apos;s usefulness, he bade him remain with him always. But as soon as the cat espied the dog in Adam&apos;s house, she began to quarrel with him, and reproach him with having broken his oath to her. Adam did his best to pacify the cat. He told her he had himself invited the dog to make his home there, and he assured her she would in no wise be the loser by the dog&apos;s presence; he wanted both to stay with him. But it was impossible to appease the cat. The dog promised her not to touch anything intended for her. She insisted that she could not live in one and the same house with a thief like the dog. Bickerings between the dog and the cat became the order of the day. Finally the dog could stand it no longer, and he left Adam&apos;s house, and betook himself to Seth&apos;s. By Seth he was welcomed kindly, and from Seth&apos;s house, he continued to make efforts at reconciliation with the cat. In vain. Yes, the enmity between the first dog and the first cat was transmitted to all their descendants until this very day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Even the physical peculiarities of certain animals were not original features with them, but owed their existence to something that occurred subsequent to the days of creation. The mouse at first had quite a different mouth from its present mouth. In Noah&apos;s ark, in which all animals, to ensure the preservation of every kind, lived together peaceably, the pair of mice were once sitting next to the cat. Suddenly the latter remembered that her father was in the habit of devouring mice, and thinking there was no harm in following his example, she jumped at the mouse, who vainly looked for a hole into which to slip out of sight. Then a miracle happened; a hole appeared where none had been before, and the mouse sought refuge in it. The cat pursued the mouse, and though she could not follow her into the hole, she could </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">insert her paw and try to pull the mouse out of her covert. Quickly the mouse opened her mouth in the hope that the paw would go into it, and the cat would be prevented from fastening her claws in her flesh. But as the cavity of the mouth was not big enough, the cat succeeded in clawing the cheeks of the mouse. Not that this helped her much, it merely widened the mouth of the mouse, and her prey after all escaped the cat. After her happy escape, the mouse betook herself to Noah and said to him, &quot;O pious man, be good enough to sew up my cheek where my enemy, the cat, has torn a rent in it.&quot; Noah bade her fetch a hair out of the tail of the swine, and with this he repaired the damage. Thence the little seam-like line next to the mouth of every mouse to this very day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The raven is another animal that changed its appearance during its sojourn in the ark. When Noah desired to send him forth to find out about the state of the waters, he hid under the wings of the eagle. Noah found him, however, and said to him, &quot;Go and see whether the waters have diminished.&quot; The raven pleaded: &quot;Hast thou none other among all the birds to send on this errand?&quot; Noah: &quot;My power extends no further than over thee and the dove.&quot; But the raven was not satisfied. He said to Noah with great insolence: &quot;Thou sendest me forth only that I may meet my death, and thou wishest my death that my wife may be at thy service.&quot; Thereupon Noah cursed the raven thus: &quot;May thy mouth, which has spoken evil against me, be accursed, and thy intercourse with thy wife be only through it.&quot; All the animals in the ark said Amen. And this is the reason why a mass of spittle runs from the mouth of the male raven into the mouth of the female during the act of copulation, and only thus the female is impregnated. Altogether the raven is an unattractive animal. He is unkind toward his own young so long as their bodies are not covered with black feathers, though as a rule ravens love one another. God therefore takes the young ravens under His special protection. From their own excrement maggots come forth, which serve as their food during the three days that elapse after their birth, until their white feathers turn black and their parents recognize them as their offspring and care for them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The raven has himself to blame also for the awkward hop in his gait. He observed the graceful step of the dove, and envious of her tried to enmulate it. The outcome was that he almost broke his bones without in the least succeeding in making <text:soft-page-break/>himself resemble the dove, not to mention that he brought the scorn of the other animals down upon himself. His failure excited their ridicule. Then he decided to return to his own original gait, but in the interval he had unlearnt it, and he could walk neither the one way nor the other properly. His step had become a hop betwixt and between. Thus we see how true it is, that he who is dissatisfied with his small portion loses the little he has in stiving for more and better things.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The steer is also one of the animals that have suffered a change in the course of time. Originally his face was entirely overgrown with hair, but now there is none on his nose, and that is because Joshua kissed him on his nose during the siege of Jericho. Joshua was an exceedingly heavy man. Horses, donkeys, and mules, none could bear him, they all broke down under his weight. What they could not do, the steer accomplished. On his back Joshua rode to the siege of Jericho, and in gratitude he bestowed a kiss upon his nose.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The serpent, too, is other than it was at first. Before the fall of man it was the cleverest of all animals created, and in form it resembled man closely. It stood upright, and was of extraordinary size. Afterward, it lost the mental advantages it had possessed as compared with other animals, and it degenerated physically, too; it was deprived of its feet, so that it could not pursue other animals and kill them. The mole and the frog had to be made harmless in similar ways; the former has no eyes, else it were irresistible, and the frog has no teeth, else no animal in the water were sure of its life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While the cunning of the serpent wrought its own undoing, the cunning of the fox stood him in good stead in many an embarrassing situation. After Adam had committed the sin of disobedience, God delivered the whole of the animal world into the power of the Angel of Death, and He ordered him to cast one pair of each kind into the water. He and leviathan together thus have dominion over all that has life. When the Angel of Death was in the act of executing the Divine command upon the fox, he began to weep bitterly. The Angel of Death asked him the reason of his tears, and the fox replied that he was mourning the sad fate of his friend. At the same time he pointed to the figure of a fox in the sea, which was nothing but his own reflection. The Angel of Death, persuaded that a representative of the fox family had been cast <text:soft-page-break/>into the water, let him go free. The fox told his trick to the cat, and she in turn played it on the Angel of Death. So it happened that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while all other animals are.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When leviathan passed the animals in review, and missing the fox was informed of the sly way in which he had eluded his authority, he dispatched great and powerful fish on the errand of enticing the truant into the water. The fox walking along the shore espied the large number of fish, and he exclaimed, &quot;How happy he who may always satisfy his hunger with the flesh of such as these.&quot; The fish told him, if he would but follow them, his appetite could easily be appeased. At the same time they informed him that a great honor awaited him. Leviathan, they said, was at death&apos;s door, and he had commissioned them to install the fox as his successor. They were ready to carry him on their backs, so that he had no need to fear the water, and thus they would convey him to the throne, which stood upon a huge rock. The fox yielded to these persuasions, and descended into the water. Presently an uncomfortable feeling took possession of him. He began to suspect that the tables were turned; he was being made game of instead of making game of others as usual. He urged the fish to tell him the truth, and they admitted that they had been sent out to secure his person for leviathan, who wanted his heart, that he might become as knowing as the fox, whose wisdom he had heard many extol. The fox said reproachfully: &quot;Why did you not tell me the truth at once? Then I could have brought my heart along with me for King Leviathan, who would have showered honors upon me. As it is, you will surely suffer punishment for bringing me without my heart. The foxes, you see,&quot; he continued, &quot;do not carry their hearts around with them. They keep them in a safe place, and when they have need of them, they fetch them thence.&quot; The fish quickly swam to shore, and landed the fox, so that he might go for his heart. No sooner did he feel dry land under his feet than he began to jump and shout, and when they urged him to go in search of his heart, and follow them, he said: &quot;O ye fools, could I have followed you into the water, if I had not had my heart with me? Or exists there a creature able to go abroad without his heart?&quot; The fish replied: &quot;Come, come, thou art fooling us.&quot; Whereupon the fox: &quot;O ye fools, if I could play a trick on the Angel of Death, how much easier was it to make game of you?&quot; So they had to return, their </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">errand undone, and leviathan could not but confirm the taunting judgment of the fox: &quot;In very truth, the fox is wise of heart, and ye are fools.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P59" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_630kwcnw6wgs"/>Genesis 2</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, along with everything in them. 2 On the seventh day God was finished with his work which he had made, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 God blessed the seventh day and separated it as holy; because on that day God rested from all his work which he had created, so that it itself could produce.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Whatever God created has value.&quot; Even the animals and the insects that seem useless and noxious at first sight have a vocation to fulfil. The snail trailing a moist streak after it as it crawls, and so using up its vitality, serves as a remedy for boils. The sting of a hornet is healed by the house-fly crushed and applied to the wound. The gnat, feeble creature, taking in food but never secreting it, is a specific against the poison of a viper, and this venomous reptile itself cures eruptions, while the lizard is the antidote to the scorpion. Not only do all creatures serve man, and contribute to his comfort, but also God &quot;teacheth us through the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wise through the fowls of heaven.&quot; He endowed many animals with admirable moral qualities as a pattern for man. If the Torah had not been revealed to us, we might have learnt regard for the decencies of life from the cat, who covers her excrement with earth; regard for the property of others from the ants, who never encroach upon one another&apos;s stores; and regard for decorous conduct from the cock, who, when he desires to unite with the hen, promises to buy her a cloak long enough to reach to the ground, and when the hen reminds him of his promise, he shakes his comb and says, &quot;May I be deprived of my comb, if I do not buy it when I have the means.&quot; The grasshopper also has a lesson to teach to man. All the summer through it sings, until its belly bursts, and death claims it. Though it knows the fate that awaits it, yet it sings on. So man should do his duty toward God, no matter what the consequences. The stork should be taken as a model in two respects. He guards the purity of his family life zealously, and toward his fellows he is compassionate and <text:soft-page-break/>merciful. Even the frog can be the teacher of man. By the side of the water there lives a species of animals which subsist off aquatic creatures alone. When the frog notices that one of them is hungry, he goes to it of his own accord, and offers himself as food, thus fulfilling the injunction, &quot;If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The whole of creation was called into existence by God unto His glory, and each creature has its own hymn of praise wherewith to extol the Creator. Heaven and earth, Paradise and hell, desert and field, rivers and seas--all have their own way of paying homage to God. The hymn of the earth is, &quot;From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, glory to the Righteous.&quot; The sea exclaims, &quot;Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Also the celestial bodies and the elements proclaim the praise of their Creator--the sun, moon, and stars, the clouds and the winds, lightning and dew. The sun says, &quot;The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, at the light of Thine arrows as they went, at the shining of Thy glittering spear&quot;; and the stars sing, &quot;Thou art the Lord, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Every plant, furthermore, has a song of praise. The fruitful tree sings, &quot;Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy, before the Lord, for He cometh; for He cometh to judge the earth&quot;; and the ears of grain on the field sing, &quot;The pastures are covered with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Great among singers of praise are the birds, and greatest among them is the cock. When God at midnight goes to the pious in Paradise, all the trees therein break out into adoration, and their songs awaken the cock, who begins in turn to praise God. Seven times he crows, each time reciting a verse. The first verse is: &quot;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.&quot; The second verse: &quot;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The <text:soft-page-break/>Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.&quot; The third: &quot;Arise, ye righteous, and occupy yourselves with the Torah, that your reward may be abundant in the world hereafter.&quot; The fourth: &quot;I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord!&quot; The fifth: &quot;How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?&quot; The sixth: &quot;Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.&quot; And the seventh verse sung by the cock runs: &quot;It is time to work for the Lord, for they have made void Thy law.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The song of the vulture is: &quot;I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them, and they shall increase as they have increased&quot;--the same verse with which the bird will in time to come announce the advent of the Messiah, the only difference being, that when he heralds the Messiah he will sit upon the ground and sing his verse, while at all other times he is seated elsewhere when he sings it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Nor do the other animals praise God less than the birds. Even the beasts of prey give forth adoration. The lion says: &quot;The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man; He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war; He shall cry, yea, He shall shout aloud; He shall do mightily against his enemies.&quot; And the fox exhorts unto justice with the words: &quot;Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor&apos;s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yea, the dumb fishes know how to proclaim the praise of their Lord. &quot;The voice of the Lord is upon the waters,&quot; they say, &quot;the God of glory thundereth, even the Lord upon many waters&quot;; while the frog exclaims, &quot;Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Contemptible though they are, even the reptiles give praise unto their Creator. The mouse extols God with the words: &quot;Howbeit Thou art just in all that is come upon me; for Thou hast dealt truly, but I have done wickedly.&quot; And the cat sings: &quot;Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.&quot;</text:p>

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her; and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">ON the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on the border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising, one finds nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and reaches unto the borders of heaven.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">2 And to the north of the garden there is a sea of wafer, clear and pure to the taste, like unto nothing else; so that, through the clearness thereof, one may</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">look into the depths of the earth.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>4 And God created that sea of His own good pleasure, for He knew what would come of the man He should make; so that after he had left the garden, on account of his transgression, men should be born in the earth, from among whom righteous ones should die, whose souls God would raise at the last day; when they should return to their flesh; should bathe in the water of that sea, and all of them repent of their sins.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did not place him on the border of it northward, lest he should draw near to the sea of water, and he and Eve wash themselves in it, be cleansed from their sins, forget the transgression they had committed, and he no longer reminded of it in the thought of their punishment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then, again, as to the southern side of the garden, God was not pleased to let Adam dwell there; because, when the wind blew from the north, it would bring him, on that southern side, the delicious smell of the trees of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Wherefore God did not put Adam there, lest he should smell the sweet smell of those trees forget his transgression, and find consolation for what he had done, take delight in the smell of the trees, and not be cleansed from his transgression.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Again, also, because God is merciful and of great pity, and governs all things in a way He alone knows--He made our father Adam dwell in the western border of the garden, because on that side the earth is very broad.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And God commanded him to dwell there in a cave in a rock--the Cave of Treasures below the garden.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;If I had let My wrath fall heavily upon thee, I should have destroyed thee; and had I turned thee into darkness, it would have been as if I killed thee.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;For I knew thou shouldest sin and transgress, and come out into this land.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 &quot;Had I not been and spoken to thee, O Adam, concerning the tree, and had I left thee without a commandment, and thou hadst sinned--it would have been an offence on My part, for not having given thee any order; thou wouldst turn round and blame Me for it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 &quot;But I commanded thee, and warned thee, and thou didst fall. So that My creatures cannot blame me; but the blame rests on them alone.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15). The fall of night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures where they dwelt. But when they neared it and saw it from afar, heavy sorrow fell upon Adam and Eve when they looked at it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then Adam said to Eve, &quot;When we were on the mountain we were comforted by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that came from the east, shone over us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 &quot;But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shone over us is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come upon us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 &quot;And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, wherein darkness covers us, so that we are parted from each other; and thou canst not see me, neither can I see thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 When Adam had said these words, they wept and spread their hands before God; for they were full of sorrow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And they entreated God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so that darkness return not upon them, and they come not again under this covering of rock. And they wished to die rather than see the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then God looked upon Adam and Eve and upon their great sorrow, and upon all they had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they were in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the misery that came upon them in a strange land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Therefore God was not wroth with them; nor impatient with them; but He was longsuffering and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He had created.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, &quot;Adam, as for the sun, if I were to take it and bring it to thee, days, hours, years and months would all come to naught, and the covenant I have made with thee, would never be fulfilled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;But thou shouldest then be turned and left in a long plague, and no salvation would be left to thee for ever.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Yea, rather, bear long and calm thy soul while thou abidest night and day; until the fulfilment of the days, and the time of My covenant is come.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;Then shall I come and save thee, O Adam, for I do not wish that thou be afflicted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;And when I look at all the good things in which thou didst live, and why thou camest out of them, then would I willingly show thee mercy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>14 &quot;But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth; else would I have brought thee back into the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 &quot;When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show thee and thy seed mercy, and bring thee into a land of gladness, where there is neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness, and light that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden that shall never pass away.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 And God said again unto Adam, &quot;Be long-suffering and enter the cave, for the darkness, of which thou wast afraid, shall only be twelve hours long; and when ended, light shall arise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped before Him, and their hearts were comforted. They returned into the cave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave their body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 And Adam and Eve stood praying, until the darkness of night came upon them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 And they remained standing in prayer.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued in prayer, and how God communed with them, and comforted them, and how He had accepted their offering--Satan made an apparition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 He began with transforming his hosts; in his hands was a flashing fire, and they were in a great light.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave because he could not enter into it by reason of their prayers. And he shed light into the cave, until the cave glistened over Adam and Eve; while his hosts began to sing praises.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>4 And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light, he should think within himself that it was a heavenly light, and that Satan&apos;s hosts were angels; and that God had sent them to watch at the cave, and to give him light in the darkness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them, and Adam and Eve bowed to Satan, then he would overcome Adam thereby, and a second time humble him before God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 When, therefore, Adam and Eve saw the light, fancying it was real, they strengthened their hearts; yet, as they were trembling, Adam said to Eve:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;Look at that great light, and at those many songs of praise, and at that host standing outside that do not come in to us, do not tell us what they say, or whence they come, or what is the meaning of this light; what those praises are; wherefore they have been sent hither, and why they do not come in.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;If they were from God, they would come to us in the cave, and would tell us their errand.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then Adam stood up and prayed unto God with a fervent heart, and said:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;O Lord, is there in the world another god than Thou, who created angels and filled them with light, and sent them to keep us, who would come with them?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;But, lo, we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave; they are in a great light; they sing loud praises. If they are of some other god than Thou, tell me; and if they are sent by Thee, inform me of the reason for which Thou hast sent them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God appeared unto him in the cave, who said unto him, &quot;O Adam, fear not. This is Satan and his hosts; he wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first. For the first time, he was hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to you in the similitude of an angel of light; in order that, when you worshipped him, he might enthrall you, in the very presence of God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then the angel went from Adam, and seized Satan at the opening of the cave, and stripped him of the feint he had assumed, and brought him in his own hideous form to Adam and Eve; who were afraid of him when they saw him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>14 And the angel said to Adam, &quot;This hideous form has been his ever since God made him fall from heaven. He could not have come near you in it; therefore did he transform himself into an angel of light.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam and Eve, and said unto them, &quot;Fear not; God who created you, will strengthen you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 And the angel went from them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 But Adam and Eve remained </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">standing in the cave; no consolation came to them; they were divided in their thoughts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out to seek the garden. For their hearts were towards it, and they could get no consolation for having left it.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT when the wily Satan saw them, that they were going to the garden, he gathered together his host, and came in appearance upon a cloud, intent on deceiving them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they were angels of God come to comfort them about their having left the garden, or to bring them back again into it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And Adam spread his hands unto God, beseeching Him to make him understand what they were.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, said unto Adam, &quot;O Adam, I am an angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;God has sent me and them to take thee and bring thee to the border of the garden northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe thee and Eve in it, and raise you to your former gladness, that ye return again to the garden.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, &quot;Behold, we go to the sea of water,&quot; and they began to go.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a very high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew near to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and not in a vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them, and to wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should remain to him and his hosts alone.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the top of the mountain, whence they saw below them the wide world, high above which they were. But they saw none of the host which anon were by them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 They wept, both Adam and Eve, before G od, and begged for forgiveness of Him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;Then it was in that third hour of Friday, in which Thou didst create me, and didst command me concerning the tree, to which I was neither to draw near, nor to eat thereof; for Thou saidst to me in the garden, &apos;When thou eatest of it, of death thou shalt die.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;And if Thou hadst punished me as Thou saidst, with death, I should have died that very moment.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;Then, at the end of the third hour of that Friday, O Lord, Thou didst cause a slumber and a sleep to come over me, and I slept, and was overwhelmed in sleep.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 &quot;Then Thou didst draw a rib out of my side, and created it after my own similitude and image. Then I awoke; and when I saw her and knew who she was, I said, &apos;This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; henceforth she shall be called woman.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 &quot;It was of Thy good will, O God, that Thou broughtest a slumber and a sleep over me, and that Thou didst forthwith bring Eve out of my side, until she was out, so that I did not see how she was made; neither could I witness, O my Lord, how awful and great are Thy goodness and glory.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 &quot;And of Thy goodwill, O Lord, Thou madest us both with bodies of a bright nature, and Thou madest us two, one; and Thou gavest us Thy grace, and didst fill us with praises of the Holy Spirit; that we should be neither hungry nor thirsty, nor know what sorrow is, nor yet faintness of heart; neither suffering, fasting, nor weariness.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;O Eve, it is because God is angry with us, and will drive us from it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;O Eve, we have again transgressed His commandment in that cave, so that He had sent this fire to burn around it, and to prevent us from going into it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;If this be really so, O Eve, where shall we dwell? And whither shall we flee from before the face of the Lord? Since, as regards the garden, He will not let us abide in it, and He has deprived us of the good things thereof; but He has placed us in this cave, in which we have borne darkness, trials and hardships, until at last we found comfort therein.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;But now that He has brought us out into another land, who knows what may happen in it? And who knows but that the darkness of that land may be far greater than the darkness of this land?</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;O Eve, if God will bring us into a strange land other than this, in which we find consolation, it must be to put our souls to death, and blot out our name from the face of the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>11 &quot;O Eve, if we are farther estranged from the garden and from God, where shall we find Him again, and ask Him to give us gold, incense, myrrh, and some fruit of the fig-tree?</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And yet he could not curse Satan, nor injure him by word, because he had no authority over him, neither did he take to doing so with words from his mouth.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with thee, not even one day; but has deprived thee of the glory that was on thee--when thou didst yield to his command?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;Thinkest thou, Adam, that he loved thee when he made this agreement with thee? Or, that he loved thee and wished to raise thee on high?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to thee; but he wished to make thee come out of light into darkness, and from an exalted state to degradation; from glory to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and from rest to fasting and fainting.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 God said also to Adam, &quot;See this fire kindled by Satan around thy cave; see this wonder that surrounds thee; and know that it will encompass about both thee and thy seed, when ye hearken to his behest; that he will plague you with fire; and that ye shall go down into hell after ye are dead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;Then shall ye see the burning of his fire, that will thus be burning around you and your seed. There shall be no deliverance from it for you, but at My coming; in like manner as thou canst not now go into thy cave, by reason of the great fire around it; not until My Word shall come that will make a way for thee on the day My covenant is fulfilled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;There is no way for thee at present to come from hence to rest, not until My Word comes, who is My Word. Then will He make a way for thee, and thou shalt have rest.&quot; Then God called with His Word to that fire that burned around the cave, that it part itself asunder, until Adam had gone through it. Then the fire parted itself by God&apos;s order, and a way was made for Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Adam and Eve began again to come into the cave. And when they came to the way between the fire, Satan blew into the fire like a whirlwind, and made on Adam and Eve a burning coal-fire; so that their bodies were singed; and the coal-fire scorched them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 And from the burning of the fire Adam and Eve cried aloud, and said, &quot;O Lord, save us! Leave us not to be consumed and plagued by this burning fire; neither require us for having transgressed Thy commandment.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then God looked upon their bodies, on which Satan had caused fire to bum, and God sent His angel that stayed the burning fire. But the wounds remained on their bodies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And God said unto Adam, &quot;See Satan&apos;s love for thee, who pretended to give thee the Godhead and greatness; and, behold, he burns thee with fire, and seeks to destroy thee from off the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;Then look at Me, O Adam; I created thee, and how many times have I delivered thee out of his hand? If not, would he not have destroyed thee?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 God said again to Eve, &quot;What is that he promised thee in the garden, saying, &apos;At the time ye shall eat of the tree, your eyes will be opened, and you shall become like gods, knowing good and evil.&apos; But lo! he has burnt your bodies with fire, and has made you taste the taste of fire, for the taste of the garden; and has made you see the burning of fire, and the evil thereof, and the power it has over you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;Your eyes have seen the good he has taken from you, and in truth he has opened your eyes; and you have seen the garden in which ye were with Me, and ye have also seen the evil that has come upon you from Satan.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that had scorched their bodies. So Adam said to Eve:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 &quot;Lo, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be when we are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls? Is not our deliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in mercy to us fulfil His promise?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing themselves for coming into it once more. For it was in their thoughts, that they never should enter it, when they saw the fire around it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing Adam and Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it. After the sun had set, they went out of it. This was the forty-seventh day after they came out of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep, as they were wont.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then fell asleep under the summit of the mountain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: Whereas God has promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would deliver him out of all the hardships that have befallen him-but has not promised me by covenant, and will not deliver me out of my hardships; nay, since He has promised him that He should make him and his seed dwell in the kingdom in which I once was--I will kill Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that when he is dead he may not have any seed left to inherit the kingdom that shall remain my own realm; God will then be in want of me, and He will restore me to it with my hosts.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 He then said to his hosts, &quot;Take up this stone, and throw it flat upon them, so that it roll not from them to somewhere else. And when ye have hurled it, flee and tarry not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 And they did as he bid them. But as the rock fell down from the mountain upon Adam and Eve, God commanded it to become a kind of shed over them, that did them no harm. And so it was by God&apos;s order.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But when the rock fell, the whole earth quaked with it, and. was shaken from the size of the rock.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And as it quaked and shook, Adam and Eve awoke from sleep, and found themselves under a rock like a shed. But they knew not how it was; for when they fell asleep they were under the sky, and not under a shed; and when they saw it, they were afraid.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>10 Then Adam said to Eve, &quot;Wherefore has the mountain bent itself, and the earth quaked and shaken on our account? And why has this rock spread itself over us like a tent?</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;He is angry with us for our having come out of the cave without His order; and for our having done so of our own accord, without consulting Him, when we left the cave and came to this place.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then Eve said, &quot;If, indeed, the earth quaked for our sake, and this rock forms a tent over us because of our transgression, then woe be to us, O Adam, for our punishment will be long.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;And this sign, O Adam, will happen to Me at My coming upon earth: Satan will raise the people of the Jews Jo put Me to death; and they will lay Me in a rock, and seal a large stone upon Me, and I shall remain within that rock three days and three nights.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be salvation to thee, O Adam, and to thy seed, to believe in Me. But, O Adam, I will not bring thee from under this rock until three days and three nights are passed.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;He gathered together his hosts, and deceived them, promising them to give them a great kingdom, a divine nature; and other promises he made them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;His hosts believed that. his word was true, so they yielded to him, and renounced the glory of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;He then sent for us according to the orders in which we were-to come under his command, and to hearken to his vain promise. But we would not, and we took not his advice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;Then after he had fought with God, and had dealt forwardly with Him, he gathered together his hosts, and made war with us. And if it had not been for God&apos;s strength that was with us, we could not have prevailed against him to hurl him from heaven.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;But when he fell from among us, there was great joy in heaven, because of his going down from us. For had he continued in heaven, nothing, not even one angel would have remained in it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 &quot;But God in His mercy, drove him from among us to this dark earth; for he had become darkness itself and a worker of unrighteousness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>15 &quot;And he has continued, O Adam, to make war against thee, until he beguiled thee and made thee come out of the garden, to this strange land, where all these trials have come to thee. And death, which God brought upon him he has also brought to thee, O Adam, because thou didst obey him, and didst transgress against God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 Then a the angels rejoiced and praised God, and asked Him not to destroy Adam this time, for his having sought to enter the garden; but to bear with him until the fulfilment of the promise; and to help him in this world until he was free from Satan&apos;s hand.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">A chapter of divine comfort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 &quot;O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and behold the angels who are in the garden-that is full of them, and see thyself alone on this earth, with Satan whom thou didst obey.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 &quot;Yet, if thou hadst submitted, and been obedient to Me, and hadst kept My Word, thou wouldst be with My angels in My garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 &quot;But when thou didst transgress and hearken to Satan, thou didst become his guest among his angels, that are full of wickedness; and thou camest to this earth, that brings forth to thee thorns and thistles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;O Adam, ask him who deceived thee, to give thee the divine nature he promised thee, or to make thee a garden as I had made for thee; or to fill thee with that same bright nature with which I had filled thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;Ask him to make thee a body like the one I made thee, or to give thee a day of rest as I gave thee; or to create within thee a reasonable soul, as I did create for thee; or to remove thee hence to some other earth than this one which I gave thee. But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of the things he told thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>7 &quot;Acknowledge, then, My favour towards thee, and My mercy on thee, My creature; that I have not requited thee for thy transgression against Me, but in My pity for thee I have promised thee that at the end of the great five days and a half I will come and save thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then God said again to Adam and Eve, &quot;Arise, go down hence, lest the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroy you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 But Adam&apos;s heart was comforted by God&apos;s words to him, and he worshipped before Him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with joy, instead of the fear that had come upon them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they brought them to the cave. There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them, and then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had sent them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 But, after the angels were gone from Adam and Eve, came Satan, with shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were Adam and Eve. He then called to Adam, and said, &quot;O Adam, come, let me speak to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God&apos;s angels that was come to give him some good counsel.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">&quot;Therefore did I fall. . .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT when Adam came out and saw his hideous figure, he was afraid of him, and said unto him, &quot;Who art thou?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then Satan answered and said unto him, &quot;It is I, who hid myself within the serpent, and who talked to Eve, and beguiled her until she hearkened to my command. I am he who sent her, through the wiles of my speech, to deceive thee, until thou and she ate of the fruit of the tree, and ye came away from under the command of God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 But when Adam heard these words from him, he said unto him, &quot;Canst thou make me a garden as God made for me? Or canst thou clothe me in the same bright nature in which God had clothed me?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 &quot;Where is the divine nature thou didst promise to give me? Where is that fair speech of thine, thou didst hold with us at first, when we were in the garden?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Satan said unto Adam, &quot;Thinkest thou, that when I have spoken to one about anything, I shall ever bring it to him or fulfil my word? Not so. For I myself have never even thought of obtaining what I asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;Therefore did I fall, and did I make you fall by that for which I myself fell; and with you also, whosoever accepts my counsel, falls thereby.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;But now, O Adam, by reason of thy fall thou art under my rule, and I am king over thee; because thou hast hearkened to me, and hast transgressed against thy God. Neither will there be any deliverance from my hands until the day promised thee by thy God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Again he said, &quot;Inasmuch as we do not know the day agreed upon with thee by thy God, nor the hour in which thou shalt be delivered, for that reason will we multiply war and murder upon thee and thy seed after thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not leave one of the sons of men to inherit our orders in heaven.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;For as to our abode, O Adam, it is in burning fire; and we will not cease our evil doing no, not one day nor one hour. And I, O Adam, shall sow fire upon thee when thou comest into the cave to dwell there.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 When Adam heard these words he wept and mourned, and said unto Eve, &quot;Hear what he said; that he will not fulfil aught of what he told thee in the garden. Did he really then become king over us?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;But we will ask God, who created us, to deliver us out of his hands.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Book 58</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;About sunset on the 53rd day . . . .&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Adam and Eve spread their hands unto God, praying and entreating Him to drive Satan away from them; that he do them no violence, and do not force them to deny God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then God sent to them at once His angel, who drove away Satan--from them. This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they had come out of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their faces to the earth, to pray to God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But ere they prayed Adam said unto Eve, &quot;Lo, thou hast seen what temptations have befallen us in this land. Come, let us arise, and ask God to forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come out until the end of the day next to the fortieth. And if we die herein, He will save us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Adam and Eve arose, and joined together in entreating God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 They abode thus praying in the cave; neither did they come out of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their mouths, like a flame of fire.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Eighth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT Satan, the hater of all good, did not allow them to end their prayers. For he called to his hosts, and they came, all of them. He then said to them, &quot;Since Adam and Eve, whom we beguiled, have agreed together to pray to God night and day, and to entreat Him to deliver them, and since they will not come out of the cave until the end of the fortieth day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 &quot;And since they will continue their prayers as they have both agreed to do, that He will deliver them out of our hands, and restore them to their former state, see what we shall do unto them.&quot; And his hosts said unto him, &quot;Power is thine, O our Lord, to do what thou listest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came into the cave, in the thirtieth night of the forty days and one; and he smote Adam and Eve, until he left them dead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then came the Word of God unto Adam and Eve, who raised them from their suffering, and God said unto Adam, &quot;Be strong, and be not afraid of him who has just come to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 But Adam wept and said, &quot;Where wast Thou, O my God, that they should smite me with such blows, and that this suffering should come upon us; upon me and upon Eve, Thy handmaid?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then God said unto him, &quot;O Adam, see, he is lord and master of all thou hast, he who said, he would give thee divinity. Where is this love for thee? And where is the gift he promised?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;For once has it pleased him, O Adam, to come to thee, to comfort thee, and to strengthen thee, and to rejoice with thee, and to send his hosts to guard thee; because thou hast hearkened to him, and hast yielded to his counsel; and hast transgressed My commandment but has followed his behest?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then Adam wept before the Lord, and said, &quot;O Lord because I transgressed a little, Thou hast sorely plagued me in return for it, I ask Thee to deliver me out of his hands; or else have pity on me, and take my soul out of my body now in this strange land.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then God said unto Adam, &quot;If only there had been this sighing and praying before, ere thou didst transgress! Then wouldst thou have rest from the trouble in which thou art now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve remain in the cave until they had fulfilled the forty days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">11 But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered from fasting and praying, from hunger and thirst; for they had not tasted either food or drink since they left the garden; nor were the functions of their bodies yet settled; and they had no </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">strength left to continue in prayer from hunger, until the end of the next day to the fortieth. They were fallen down in the cave; yet what speech escaped from their mouths, was only in praises.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">The Devil appears like an old man. He offers &quot;a place of rest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad in a garment of light, and girt about with a bright girdle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful: but his face was pleasant and his speech was sweet,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and Eve, and to make them come out of the cave, ere they had fulfilled the forty days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 For he said within himself, &quot;Now that when they had fulfilled the forty days&apos; fasting and praying, God would restore them to their former estate; but if He did not do so, He would still be favourable to them; and even if He had not mercy on them, would He yet give them something from the garden to comfort them; as already twice before.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Satan drew near the cave in this fair appearance, and said:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;O Adam, rise ye, stand up, thou and Eve, and come along with me, to a good land; and fear not. I am flesh and bones like you; and at first I was a creature that God created.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed me in a garden in the north, on the border of the world.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;And He said to me, &apos;Abide here!&apos; And I abode there according to His Word, neither did I transgress His commandment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He brought thee, O Adam, out of my side, but did not make thee abide by me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>10 &quot;But God took thee in His divine hand, and placed thee in a garden to the eastward.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Then I grieved because of thee, for that while God had taken thee out of my side, He had not let thee abide with me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;But God said unto me: &apos;Grieve not because of Adam, whom I brought out of thy side; no harm will come to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;&apos;For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet for him; and I have given him joy by so doing.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then Satan said again, &quot;I did not know how it is ye are in this cave, nor anything about this trial that has come upon you-until God said to me, &apos;Behold, Adam has transgressed, he whom I had taken out of thy side, and Eve also, whom I took out of his side; and I have driven them out of the garden; I have made them dwell in a land of sorrow and misery, because they transgressed against Me, and have hearkened to Satan. And lo, they are in suffering unto this day, the eightieth.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 &quot;Then God said unto me, &apos;Arise, go to them, and make them come to thy place, and suffer not that Satan come near them, and afflict them. For they are now in great misery; and lie helpless from hunger.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 &quot;He further said to me, &apos;When thou hast taken them to thyself, give them to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and give them to drink of the water of peace; and clothe them in a garment of light, and restore them to their former state of grace, and leave them not in misery, for they came from thee. But grieve not over them, nor repent of that which has come upon them.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 &quot;But when I heard this, I was sorry; and my heart could not patiently bear it for thy sake, O my child.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 &quot;But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was afraid, and I said within myself, I will not come out, lest he ensnare me, as he did my children, Adam and Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 &quot;And I said, &apos;O God, when I go to my children, Satan will meet me in the way, and war against me, as he did against them.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>20 &quot;Then God said unto me, &apos;Fear not; when thou findest him, smite him with the staff that is in thine hand, and be not afraid of him for thou art of old standing, and he shall not prevail against thee.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 &quot;Then I said, &apos;O my Lord, I am old, and cannot go. Send Thy angels to bring them.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">22 &quot;But God said unto me, &apos;Angels, verily, are not like them; and they will not consent to come with them. But I have chosen thee, because they are thy offspring, and like thee, and will hearken to what thou sayest.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 &quot;God said further to me, &apos;If thou hast not strength to walk, I will send a cloud to carry thee and alight thee at the entrance of their cave; then the cloud will return and leave thee there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 &quot;&apos;And if they will come with thee, I will send a cloud to carry thee and them.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">25 &quot;Then He commanded a cloud, and it bare me up and brought me to you; and then went back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">26 &quot;And now O my children, Adam and Eve, look at my hoar hairs and at my feeble estate, and at my coming from that distant place. Come, come with me, to a place of rest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">27 Then he began to weep and to sob before Adam and Eve, and his tears poured upon the earth like water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">28 And when Adam and Eve raised their eyes and saw his beard, and heard his sweet talk, their hearts softened towards him; they hearkened unto him, for they believed he was true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">29 And it seemed to them that they really were his offspring, when they saw that his face was like their own; and they trusted him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">They begin to follow Satan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN he took Adam and Eve by the hand, and began to bring them out of the cave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>2 But when they were come a little way out of it, God knew that Satan had overcome them, and had brought them out ere the forty days were ended, to take them to some distant place, and to destroy them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then the Word of the Lord God again came and cursed Satan, and drove him away from them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And God began to speak unto Adam and Eve, saying to them, &quot;What made you come out of the cave, unto this place?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Adam said unto God, &quot;Didst thou create a man before us? For when we were in the cave there suddenly came unto us a good old man who said to us, &apos;I am a messenger from God unto you, to bring you back to some place of rest.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;And we did believe, O God, that he was a messenger from Thee; and we came out with him; and knew not whither we should go with him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then God said unto Adam, &quot;See, that is the father of evil arts, who brought thee and Eve out of the Garden of Delights. And now, indeed, when he saw that thou and Eve both joined together in fasting and praying, and that you came not out of the cave before the end of the forty days, he wished to make your purpose vain, to break your mutual bond; to cut off all hope from you, and to drive you to some place where he might destroy you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;Because he was unable to do aught to you, unless he showed himself in the likeness of you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;Therefore did he come to you with a face like your own, and began to give you tokens as if they were all true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;But I in mercy and with the favour I had unto you, did not allow him to destroy you; but I drove him away from you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Now, therefore, O Adam, take Eve, and return to your cave, and remain in it until the morrow of the fortieth day. And when ye come out, go towards the eastern gate of the garden.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>12 Then Adam and Eve worshipped God, and praised and blessed Him for the deliverance that had come to them from Him. And they returned towards the cave. This happened at eventide of the thirty-ninth day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then Adam and Eve stood up and with great zeal, prayed to God, to be brought out of their want for strength; for their strength had departed from them, through hunger and thirst and prayer. But they watched the whole of that night praying, until morning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then Adam said unto Eve, &quot;Arise, let us go towards the eastern gate of the garden as God told us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 And they said their prayers as they were wont to do every day; and they went out of the cave, to go near to the eastern gate of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and besought God to strengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy their hunger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 But when they had ended their prayers, they remained where they were by reason of their failing strength.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18. Then came the Word of God again, and said unto them, &quot;O Adam, arise, go and bring hither two figs.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 Then Adam and Eve arose, and went until they drew near to the cave.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Two fruit trees.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT Satan the wicked was envious, because of the consolation God had given them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the two figs, and buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and Eve should not find them. He also had in his thoughts to destroy them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 But by God&apos;s mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the earth, God defeated Satan&apos;s counsel regarding them; and made them into two fruit-trees, that overshadowed the cave.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with fruit, Satan grieved and mourned, and said, &quot;Better were it to have left those figs as they were; for now, behold, they have become two fruit-trees, whereof Adam will eat all the days of his life. Whereas I had in mind, when I buried them, to destroy them entirely, and to hide them for aye.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;But God has overturned my counsel; and would not that this sacred fruit should perish; and He has made plain my intention, and has defeated the counsel I had formed against His servants.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 &quot;Yet, O Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two figs; for this is our cave, in which we were. But if we should not find the two figs in it, then it cannot be our cave.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 And Adam wept and said to Eve, &quot;Are we come to a wrong cave, then, O Eve? It seems to me these two fig-trees are the two figs that were in the cave.&quot; And Eve said, &quot;I, for my part, do not know.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>6 Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, &quot;O God, Thou didst command us to come back to the cave, to take the two figs, and then to return to Thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;But now, we have not found them. O God, hast Thou taken them, and sown these two trees, or have we gone astray in the earth; or has the enemy deceived us? If it be real, then, O God, reveal to us the secret of these two trees and of the two figs.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him, &quot;O Adam, when I sent thee to fetch the figs, Satan went before thee to the cave, took the figs, and buried them outside, eastward of the cave, thinking to destroy them; and not sowing them with good intent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;Not for his mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at once; but I had mercy on thee and I commanded them to grow. And they grew to be two large trees, that you be overshadowed by their branches, and find rest; and that I make you see My power and My marvellous works.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;And, also, to show you Satan&apos;s meanness, and his evil works, for ever since ye came out of the garden, he has not ceased, no, not one day, from doing you some harm. But I have not given him power over you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 And God said, &quot;Henceforth, O Adam, rejoice on account of the trees, thou and Eve; and rest under them when ye feel weary. But eat not of their fruit, nor come near them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then Adam wept, and said, &quot;O God, wilt Thou again kill us, or wilt Thou drive us away from before Thy face, and cut our life from off the face of the earth?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;O God, I beseech Thee, if Thou knowest that there be in these trees either death or some other evil, as at the first time, root them up from near our cave, and wither them; and leave us to die of the heat, of hunger and of thirst.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 &quot;For we know Thy marvellous works, O God, that they are great, and that by Thy power Thou canst bring one thing out of another, without one&apos;s wish. For Thy power can make rocks to become trees, and trees to become rocks.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Adam and Eve partake of the first earthly food.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN God looked upon Adam and upon his strength of mind, upon his endurance of hunger and thirst, and of the heat. And he changed the two fig-trees into two figs, as they were at first, and then said to Adam and to Eve, &quot;Each of you may take one fig.&quot; And they took them, as the Lord commanded them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 And he said to them, &quot;Go ye into the cave, and eat the figs, and satisfy your hunger, lest ye die.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 So, as God commanded them, they went into the cave, about the time when the sun was setting. And Adam and Eve stood up and prayed at the time of the setting sun.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then they sat down to eat the figs; but they knew not how to eat them; for they were not accustomed to eat earthly food. They feared also lest, if they ate, their stomach should be burdened and their flesh thickened, and their hearts take to liking earthly food.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 But while they were thus seated, God, out of pity for them, sent them His angel, lest they should perish of hunger and thirst.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And the angel said unto Adam and Eve, &quot;God says to you that ye have not strength to fast until death; eat, therefore, and strengthen your bodies; for ye are now animal flesh, that cannot subsist without food and drink.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then Adam and Eve took the figs and began to eat of them. But God had put into them a mixture as of savoury bread and blood.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then the angel went from Adam and Eve, who ate of the figs until they had satisfied their hunger. Then they put by what remained; but by the power of God, the figs became full as before, because God blessed them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 After this Adam and Eve arose, and prayed with a joyful heart and renewed strength, and praised and rejoiced abundantly the whole of that night. And this was the end of the eighty-third day.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Adam and Eve acquire digestive organs. Final hope of returning to the Garden is quenched.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AND when it was day, they rose and prayed, after their custom, and then went out of the cave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But as they felt great trouble from the food they had eaten, and to which they were not used, they went about in the cave saying to each other:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 &quot;What has happened to us through eating, that this pain should have come upon us? Woe be to us, we shall die! Better for us to have died than to have eaten; and to have kept our bodies pure, than to have defiled them with food.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then Adam said to Eve, &quot;This pain did not come to us in the garden, neither did we eat such bad food there. Thinkest thou, O Eve, that God will plague us through the food that is in us, or that our inwards will come out; or that God means to kill us with this pain before He has fulfilled His promise to us?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Adam besought the Lord and said, &quot;O Lord, let us not perish through the food we have eaten. O Lord, smite us not; but deal with us according to Thy great mercy, and forsake us not until the day of the promise Thou hast made us.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then God looked upon them, and at once fitted them for eating food; as unto this day; so that they should not perish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and weeping because of the alteration in their nature. And they both knew from that hour that they were altered beings, that their hope of returning to the garden was now cut off; and that they could not enter it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all flesh that requires food and drink for its existence, cannot be in the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">9 Then Adam said to Eve, &quot;Behold, our hope is now cut off; and so is our trust to enter the garden. We no longer belong to the inhabitants of the garden; but </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">henceforth we are earthy and of the dust, and of the inhabitants of the earth, We shall not return to the garden, until the day in which God has promised to save us, and to bring us again into the garden, as He promised us.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them; after which, their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken, and their longing was cooled down; and they were like strangers on earth. That night Adam and Eve spent in the cave, where they slept heavily by reason of the food they had eaten.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Book 65</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Adam does his first day&apos;s work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve prayed in the cave, and Adam said unto Eve, &quot;Lo, we asked for food of God, and He gave it. But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of water.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then they arose, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that was on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown themselves. And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He would command them to drink of the water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him, &quot;O Adam, thy body is become brutish, and requires water to drink. Take ye, and drink, thou and Eve; give thanks and praise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Adam and Eve then drew near, and drank of it, until their bodies felt refreshed. After having drunk, they praised God, and then returned to their cave, after their former custom. This happened at the end of eighty-three days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took two figs and hung them in the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and a blessing from God. And they placed them there until there should arise a posterity to them, who should see the wonderful things God had done to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and besought God to show them some food wherewith to nourish their bodies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>7 Then the Word of God came and said unto him, &quot;O Adam, go down to the westward of the cave, as far as a land of dark soil, and there thou shalt find food.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 And Adam hearkened unto the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of dark soil, and found there wheat growing, in the ear and ripe, and figs to eat; and Adam rejoiced over it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said unto him, &quot;Take of this wheat and make thee bread of it, to nourish thy body withal.&quot; And God gave Adam&apos;s heart wisdom, to work out the corn until it became bread.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary. He then returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is done with wheat, until it is made into bread for one&apos;s use.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P59" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_weurbufruds8"/>Book 67</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36">&quot;Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve. . . .&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT when Adam and Eve went down to the land of black mud, and came near to the wheat God had showed them, and saw it ripe and ready for reaping, as they had no sickle to reap it withal--they girt themselves, and began to pull up the wheat, until it was all done.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then they made it into a heap; and, faint from heat and from thirst, they went under a shady tree, where the breeze fanned them to sleep.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 But Satan saw what Adam and Eve had done. And he called his hosts, and said to them, &quot;Since God has shown to Adam and Eve all about this wheat, wherewith to strengthen their bodies--and, lo, they are come and have made a heap of it, and faint from the toil are now asleep--come, let us set fire to this heap of corn, and burn it, and let us take that bottle of water that is by them, and empty it out, so that they may find nothing to drink, and we kill them with hunger and thirst.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">4 &quot;Then, when they wake up from their sleep, and seek to return to the cave, we will come to them in the way, and will lead them astray; so that they die of hunger and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">thirst; when they may, perhaps, deny God, and He destroy them. So shall we be rid of them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Satan and his hosts threw fire upon the wheat and consumed it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 But from the heat of the flame Adam and Eve awoke from their sleep, and saw the wheat burning, and the bucket of water by them, poured out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then they wept and went back to the cave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But as they were going up from below the mountain where they were, Satan and his hosts met them in the form of angels, praising God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then Satan said to Adam, &quot;O Adam, why art thou so pained with hunger and thirst? It seems to me that Satan has burnt up the wheat.&quot; And Adam said to him, &quot;Ay.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Again Satan said to Adam, &quot;Come back with us; we are angels of God. God sent us to thee, to show thee another field of corn, better than that; and beyond it is a fountain of good water, and many trees, where thou shalt dwell near it, and work the corn-field to better purpose than that which Satan has consumed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Adam thought that he was true, and that they were angels who talked with him; and he went back with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12. Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve eight days, until they both fell down as if dead, from hunger, thirst, and faintness. Then he fled with his hosts, and left them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">How destruction and trouble is of Satan when he is the master. Adam and Eve establish the custom of worship.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN God looked upon Adam and Eve, and upon what had come upon them from Satan, and how he had made them perish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their state of death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, &quot;O God, Thou hast burnt and taken from us the corn Thou hadst given us, and Thou hast emptied out the bucket of water. And Thou hast sent Thy angels, who have waylaid us from the corn-field. Wilt Thou make us perish? If this be from Thee, O God, then take away our souls; but punish us not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then God said to Adam, &quot;I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not pour the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead thee astray.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;But it is Satan, thy master who did it; he to whom thou hast subjected thyself; My commandment being meanwhile set aside. He it is, who burnt down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led thee astray; and all the promises he has made you, verily are but feint, and deceit, and a lie.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;But now, O Adam, thou shalt acknowledge My good deeds done to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to the field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at God&apos;s power. And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when they were hungry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And God adjured Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy the field of corn.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and took it and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had offered up their first offering of blood.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 And they offered this oblation again on the altar they had built at first. And they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying, &quot;Thus, O God, when we were in the garden, did our praises go up to Thee, like this offering; and our innocence went up to thee like incense. But now, O God, accept this offering from us, and turn us not back, reft of Thy mercy.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">12 Then God said to Adam and Eve, &quot;Since ye have made this oblation and have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down upon earth to save you; </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and I shall cause it to be offered continually upon an altar, for forgiveness and for mercy, unto those who partake of it duly.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 And God sent a bright fire upon the offering of Adam and Eve, and filled it with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came down upon that oblation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then God commanded an angel to take fire-tongs, like a spoon, and with it to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve. And the angel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were filled with joy and gladness and with the praises of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 And God said to Adam, &quot;This shall be unto you a custom, to do so, when affliction and sorrow come upon you. But your deliverance and your entrance into the garden, shall not be until the days are fulfilled, as agreed between you and Me; were it not so, I would, of My mercy and pity for you, bring you back to My garden and to My favour for the sake of the offering you have just made to My name.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve worshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to the Cave of Treasures.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the eightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then went out of the cave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering they had made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, &quot;Let us do this three times every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the preparation day Friday, and on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was pleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each taken with the other.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>22 After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, &quot;O Adam, thou hast determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come upon Me, when I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the preparation day Friday.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 &quot;But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised the heavens. And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I create joy, and raise them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer this oblation, all the days of thy life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">25 But Adam continued to offer this oblation thus, every week three times, until, the end of seven weeks. And on the first day, which is the fiftieth, Adam made an offering as he was wont, and he and Eve took it and came to the altar before God, as He had taught them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of his offering through which he found favour with God, hastened and took a sharp stone from among sharp iron-stones; appeared in the form of a man, and went and stood by Adam and Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to pray, with his hands spread unto God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron-stone he had with him, and with it pierced Adam on the right side, when flowed blood and water, then Adam fell upon the altar like a corpse. And Satan fled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the altar. And there she stayed, weeping over him; while a stream of blood flowed from Adam&apos;s side upon his offering.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 But God looked upon the death of Adam. He then sent His Word, and raised him up and said unto him, &quot;Fulfil thy offering, for indeed, Adam, it is worth much, and there is no shortcoming in it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 God said further unto Adam, &quot;Thus will it also happen to Me, on the earth, when I shall be pierced and blood shall flow blood and water from My side and run over My body, which is the true offering; and which shall be offered on the altar as a perfect offering.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when he had ended it he worshipped before God, and praised Him for the signs He had showed him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the seven weeks; and that is the fiftieth day.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 But when there a multitude of beasts came all round them. It was Satan&apos;s doing, in his wickedness; in order to wage war against Adam through marriage.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AFTER this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form n angel, and with him two others, so that they looked like the three angels who had brought to Adam gold, incense, and myrrh</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under the tree, and greeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were full of guile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 But when Adam and Eve saw their comely mien, and heard their sweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought them to Eve, and they remained all together; Adam&apos;s heart the while, being glad because he thought concerning them, that they were the same angels, who had brought him gold, incense, and myrrh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there came upon him from them, peace and joy, through their bringing him good tokens; so Adam thought that they were come a second time to give him other tokens for him to rejoice withal. For he did not know it was Satan; therefore did he receive them with joy and companied with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, &quot;Rejoice, O Adam, and be glad. Lo, God has sent us to thee to tell thee something.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And Adam said, &quot;What is it?&quot; Then Satan answered, &quot;It is a light thing, yet it is a word of God, wilt thou hear it from us and do it? But if thou hearest not, we will return to God, and tell Him that thou wouldest not receive His word.&quot; And Satan said again to Adam, &quot;Fear not, neither let a trembling come upon thee; dost not thou know us?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But Adam said, &quot;I know you not.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;But as to the other angels our fellows, who bare you to the cave, God has not sent them with us this time; for He said to us, &apos;You suffice.&apos;&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 Then Satan said to him, &quot;Lo, it is now some time since thou camest out of the garden, and thou knowest neither wickedness nor evil. But now God s says to thee, to take Eve who came out of thy side, and to wed her, that she bear thee children, to comfort thee, and to drive from thee trouble and sorrow; now this thing is not difficult, neither is there any scandal in it to thee.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Adam is troubled by his wedding with Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">BUT when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed much, because of his oath and of his promise, and said, &quot;Shall I commit adultery with my flesh and my bones, and shall I sin against myself, for God to destroy me, and to blot me out from off the face of the earth?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 &quot;Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of the garden into this strange land, and deprived me of my bright nature, and brought death upon me. If, then, I should do this, He will cut off my life from the earth, and He will cast me into hell, and will plague me there a long time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 &quot;But God never spoke the words thou hast told me; and ye are not God&apos;s angels, nor yet sent from Him. But ye are devils, come to me under the false appearance of angels . Away from me; ye cursed of God!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then those devils fled from before Adam. And he and Eve arose, and returned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 Then Adam said to Eve, &quot;If thou sawest what I did, tell it not; for I sinned against God n swearing by His great name, and I have placed my hand another time into that of Satan.&quot; Eve, then, held her peace, as Adam told her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then Adam arose, and spread his hands unto God, beseeching and entreating Him with tears, to forgive him what he had done. And Adam remained thus standing and praying forty days and forty nights. ]He neither ate nor drank until he dropped down upon the earth from hunger and thirst.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then God sent His Word unto Adam, who raised him up from where he lay, and said unto him, &quot;O Adam, why hast thou sworn by My name, and why hast thou made agreement with Satan another time?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But Adam wept, and said, &quot;O God, forgive me, for I did this unwittingly; believing they were God&apos;s angels.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And God forgave Adam, saying, to him, &quot;Beware of Satan.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 And He withdrew His Word from Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Then Adam&apos;s heart was comforted; and he took Eve, and they went out of the cave, to make some food for their bodies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his wedding Eve; afraid as he was to do it, lest God should be wroth with him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on the bank, as people do when they enjoy themselves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 But Satan was jealous of them; and would destroy them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Adam&apos;s heart is set on fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Satan, and ten from his hosts, transformed themselves into maidens, unlike any others in the whole world for grace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>2 They came up out of the river in presence of Adam and Eve, and they said among themselves, &quot;Come, we will look at the faces of Adam and of Eve, who are of the men upon earth.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Adam and Eve looked at them also, and wondered at their beauty, and said, &quot;Is there, then, under us, another world, with such beautiful creatures as these in it&quot;&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And those maidens said to Adam and Eve, &quot;Yes, indeed, we are an abundant creation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Adam said to them, &quot;But how do you multiply?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And they answered him, &quot;We have husbands who wedded us, and we bear them children, who grow up, and who in their turn wed and are wedded, and also bear children; and thus we increase. And if so be, O Adam, thou wilt not believe us, we will show thee our husbands and our children.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then they shouted over the river as if to call their husbands and their children, who came up from the river, men and children; and every one came to his wife, his children being with him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But when Adam and Eve saw them, they stood dumb, and wondered at them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then they said to Adam and Eve, &quot;You see our husbands and our children, wed Eve as we wed our wives, and you shall have children the same as we.&quot; This was a device of Satan to deceive Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Satan also thought within himself, &quot;God at first commanded Adam concerning the fruit of the tree, saying to him, &apos;Eat not of it; else of death thou shalt die.&apos; But Adam ate of it, and yet God did not kill him; He only decreed upon him death, and plagues and trials, until the day he shall come out of his body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Now, then, if I deceive him to do this thing, and to wed Eve without God&apos;s commandment, God will kill him then.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>12 Therefore did Satan work this apparition before Adam and Eve; because he sought to kill him, and to make him disappear from off the face of the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Meanwhile the fire of sin came upon Adam, and he thought of committing sin. But he restrained himself, fearing lest if he followed this advice of Satan God would put him to death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then Adam and Eve arose, and prayed to God, while Satan and his hosts went down into the river, in presence of Adam and Eve; to let them see that they were going back to their own regions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 Then Adam and Eve went back to the Cave of Treasures, as they were wont; about evening time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 And they both arose and prayed to God that night. Adam remained standing in prayer, yet not knowing how to pray, by reason of the thoughts of his heart regarding his wedding Eve; and he continued so until morning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 And when light arose, Adam said unto Eve, &quot;Arise, let us go below the mountain, where they brought us gold, and let us ask the Lord concerning this matter.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 Then Eve said, &quot;What is that matter, O Adam?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 And he answered her, &quot;That I may request the Lord to inform me about wedding thee; for I will not do it without His order, lest He make us perish, thee and me. For those devils have set my heart on fire, with thoughts of what they showed us, in their sinful apparitions.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Then Eve said to Adam, &quot;Why need we go below the mountain? Let us rather stand up and pray in our cave to God, to let us know whether this counsel is good or not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 Then Adam rose up in prayer and said, &quot;O God, thou knowest that we transgressed against Thee, and from the moment we transgressed, we were bereft of our bright nature; and our body became brutish, requiring food and drink; and with animal desires.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>22 &quot;Command us, O God, not to give way to them without Thy order, lest Thou bring us to nothing. For if Thou give us not the order, we shall be overpowered, and follow that advice of Satan; and Thou wilt again make us perish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 &quot;If not, then take our souls from us; let us be rid of this animal lust. And if Thou give us no order respecting this thing, then sever Eve from me, and me from her; and place us each far away from the other.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 &quot;Yet again, O God, when Thou hast put us asunder from each other, the devils will deceive us with their apparitions, and destroy our hearts, and defile our thoughts towards each other. Yet if it is not each of us towards the other, it will, at all events, be through their appearance when they show themselves to us.&quot; Here Adam ended his prayer.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in the prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came unto Adam and said to him, &quot;O Adam, if only thou hadst had this caution at first, ere thou earnest out of the garden into this land!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel who had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam, that they should inform him respecting his wedding Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then those angels said to Adam, &quot;Take the gold and give it to Eve as a wedding gift, and betroth her; then give her some incense and myrrh as a present; and be ye, thou and she, one flesh.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Adam hearkened to the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve&apos;s bosom in her garment; and bethrothed her with his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>6 Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve, to arise and pray forty days and forty nights; and after that, that Adam should come in to his wife; for then this would be an act pure and undefiled; and he should have children who would multiply, and replenish the face of the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the angels departed from them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then Adam and Eve began to fast and to pray, until the end of the forty days; and then they came together, as the angels had told them.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then she said unto Adam, &quot;This cave is a pure spot by reason of the signs wrought in it since we left the garden; and we shall again pray in it. It is not meet, then, that I should bring forth in it; let us rather repair to that of the sheltering rock, which Satan hurled at us, when he wished to kill us with it; but that was held up and spread as an awning over us by the command of God; and formed a cave.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then Adam removed Eve to that cave; and when the time came that she should bring forth, she travailed much.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But when Adam saw the strait in which Eve was, he arose and prayed to God, and said, &quot;O Lord, look upon me with the eye of Thy mercy, and bring her out of her distress.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 And God looked at His maid-servant Eve, and delivered her, and she brought forth her first-born son, and with him a daughter.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve. Then Adam, Eve, and the children, drew near together, and came down from the mountain, rejoicing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 But they returned not to the cave in which they were born; but came to the Cave of Treasures, in order that the children should go round it, and be blessed with the tokens brought from the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they went back to the cave in which they were born.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had taken her, and had gone with her to the river of water, in which they threw themselves at first; and there they washed themselves.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 But, as to Abel, he had a meek heart, and was obedient to his father and mother, whom he often moved to make an offering, because he loved it; and prayed and fasted much.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then came this sign to Abel. As he was coming into the Cave of Treasures, and saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he inquired of his parents Adam and Eve concerning them, and said unto them, &quot;How did you come by these?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Adam told him all that had befallen them. And Abel felt deeply about what his father told him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Furthermore his father Adam, told him of the works of God, and of the garden; and after that, he remained behind his father the whole of that night in the Cave of Treasures.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But as for Abel, he prayed to God, and drove away Satan from him; and believed not the words of the devil.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Now, therefore, I counsel thee, when they do that, to kill thy brother; then thy sister will be left for thee; and his sister will be cast, away.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 He said also to Abel, &quot;Take thou of thy sowing and make an offering and bring it to God that He may forgive thy wickedness and thy sin.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>18 But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and thrust him from the altar, and would not let him offer up his gift upon the altar; but he offered his own upon it, with a proud heart, full of guile, and fraud.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 But as for Abel, he set up stones that were near at hand, and upon that, he offered up his gift with a heart humble and free from guile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered up his gift; and he cried unto God to accept his offering; but God did not accept it from him; neither did a divine fire come down to consume his offering.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 But he remained standing over against the altar, out of humour and wroth, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if God would accept his offering or not.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">22 And Abel prayed unto God to accept his offering. Then a divine fire came down and consumed his offering. And God smelled the sweet savour of his offering; because Abel loved Him and rejoiced in Him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 And because God was well pleased with him He sent him an angel of light in the figure of man who had partaken of his offering, because He had smelled the sweet savour of his offering, and they comforted Abel and strengthened his heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother&apos;s offering, and was wroth on account of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">25 Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He had not accepted his offering.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">26 But God said unto Cain, &quot;Wherefore is thy countenance sad? Be righteous, that I may accept thy offering. Not against Me hast thou murmured, but against thyself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">27 And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and because He abhorred him and his offering.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">28 And Cain came down from the altar, his colour changed and of a woeful countenance, and came to his father and mother and told them all that had befallen him. And Adam grieved much because God had not accepted Cain&apos;s offering.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>29 But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart, and told his father and mother how God had accepted his offering. And they rejoiced at it and kissed his face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">30 And Abel said to his father, &quot;Because Cain thrust me from the altar, and would not allow me to offer my gift upon it, I made an altar for myself and offered my gift upon it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">31 But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it was the altar he had built at first, and upon which he had offered his own gifts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">32 As to Cain, he was so sullen and so angry that he went into the field, where Satan came to him and said to him, &quot;Since thy brother Abel has taken refuge with thy father Adam, because thou didst thrust him from the altar, they have kissed his face, and they rejoice over him, far more than over thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">33 When Cain heard these words of Satan, he was filled with rage; and he let no one know. But he was laying wait to kill his brother, until he brought him into the cave, and then said to him:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">34 &quot;O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such beautiful and pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at! But brother, thou hast never been one day in the field to take thy pleasure therein.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">35 &quot;To-day, O, my brother, I very much wish thou wouldest come with me into the field, to enjoy thyself and to bless our fields and our flocks, for thou art righteous, and I love thee much, O my brother! but thou hast estranged thyself from me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">36 Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the field.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">37 But before going out, Cain said to Abel, &quot;Wait for me, until I fetch a staff, because of wild beasts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">38 Then Abel stood waiting in his innocence. But Cain, the forward, fetched a staff and went out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>39 And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the way; Cain talking to him, and comforting him, to make him forget everything.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P59" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_ee2xurdv8sq5"/>Book 79</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36">A wicked plan is carried to a tragic conclusion. Cain is frightened. &quot;Am I my brother&apos;s keeper?&quot; The seven punishments. Peace is shattered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AND so they went on, until they came to a lonely place, where there were no sheep; then Abel said to Cain, &quot;Behold, my brother, we are weary of walking; for we see none of the trees, nor of the fruits, nor of the verdure, nor of the sheep, nor any one of the things of which thou didst tell me. Where are those sheep of thine thou didst tell me to bless?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then Cain said to him, &quot;Come on, and presently thou shalt see many beautiful things. but go before me, until I come up to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile; not believing his brother would kill him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with his talk, walking a little behind him; then he hastened, and smote him with the staff, blow upon blow, until he was stunned,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 But when Abel fell down upon the ground, seeing that his brother meant to kill him, he said to Cain, &quot;O, my brother, have pity on me. By the breasts we have sucked, smite me not! By the womb that bare us and that brought us into the world, smite me not unto death with that staff! If thou wilt kill me, take one of these large stones, and kill me outright.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a large stone, and smote his brother with it upon the head, until his brains oozed out, and he weltered in his blood, before him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 And Cain repented not of what he had done.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>9 But the earth, when the blood of righteous Abel fell upon it, trembled, as it drank his blood, and would have brought Cain to naught for it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 And the blood of Abel cried mysteriously to God, to avenge him of his murderer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Then Cain began at once to dig the earth wherein to lay his brother; for he was trembling from the fear that came upon him, when he saw the earth tremble on his account.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 He then cast his brother into the pit he made, and covered him with dust. But the earth would not receive him; but it threw him up at once.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Again did Cain dig the earth and hid his brother in it; but again did the earth throw him up on itself; until three times did the earth thus throw up on itself the body of Abel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 The muddy earth threw him up the first time, because he was not the first creation; and it threw him up the second time and would not receive him, because he was righteous and good, and was killed without a cause; and the earth threw him up the third time and would not receive him, that there might remain before his brother a witness against him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 And so did the earth mock Cain, until the Word of God, came to him concerning his brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 Then was God angry, and much displeased at Abel&apos;s death; and He thundered from heaven, and lightnings went before Him, and the Word of the Lord God came from heaven to Cain, and said unto him, &quot;Where is Abel thy brother?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 Then Cain answered with a proud heart and a gruff voice, &quot;How, O God? am I my brother&apos;s keeper?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 Then God said unto Cain, &quot;Cursed be the earth that has drunk the blood of Abel thy brother; and thou, be thou trembling and shaking; and this will be a sign unto thee, that whosoever finds thee, shall kill thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>19 But Cain wept because God had said those words to him; and Cain said unto Him &quot;O God, whosoever finds me shall kill me, and I shall be blotted out from the face of the earth.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Then God said unto Cain, &quot;Whosoever shall find thee shall not kill thee;&quot; because before this, God had been saying to Cain, &quot;I shall forego seven punishments on him who kills Cain.&quot; For as to the word of God to Cain, &quot;Where is thy brother?&quot; God said it in mercy for him, to try and make him repent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 For if Cain had repented at that time, and had said, &quot;O God, forgive me my sin, and the murder of my brother,&quot; God would then have forgiven him his sin.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">22 And as to God saying to Cain, &quot;Cursed be the ground that has drunk the blood of thy brother&quot; that also, was God&apos;s mercy on Cain. For God did not curse him, but He cursed the ground; although it was not the ground that had killed Abel, and had committed iniquity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 For it was meet that the curse should fall upon the murderer; yet in mercy did God so manage His thoughts as that no one should know it, and turn away from Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 And He said to him, &quot;Where is thy brother?&quot; To which he answered and said, &quot;I know not.&quot; Then the Creator said to him, &quot;Be trembling and quaking.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">25 Then Cain trembled and became terrified; and through this sign did God make him an example before all the creation, as the murderer of his brother. Also did God bring trembling and terror upon him, that he might see the peace in which he was at first, and see also the trembling and terror he endured at the last; so that he might humble himself before God, and repent of his sin, and seek the peace he enjoyed at first.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">26 And in the word of God that said, &quot;I will forego seven punishments on whomsoever kills Cain,&quot; God was not seeking to kill Cain with the sword, but He sought to make him die of fasting, and praying and weeping by hard rule, until the time that he was delivered from his sin.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">27 And the seven punishments are the seven generations during which God awaited Cain for the murder of his brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>28 But as to Cain, ever since he had killed his brother, he could find no rest in any place; but went back to Adam and Eve, trembling, terrified, and defiled with blood. . . .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN Luluwa heard Cain&apos;s words, she wept and went to her father and mother, and told them how that Cain had killed his brother Abel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then they all cried aloud and lifted up their voices, and slapped their faces, and threw dust upon their heads, and rent asunder their garments, and went out and came to the place where Abel was killed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And they found him lying on the earth, killed, and beasts around him; while they wept and cried because of this just one. From his body, by reason of its purity, went forth a smell of sweet spices.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And Adam carried him, his tears streaming down his face; and went to the Cave of Treasures, where he laid him, and wound him up with sweet spices and myrrh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 And Adam and Eve continued by the burial of him in great grief a hundred and forty days. Abel was fifteen and a half years old, and Cain seventeen years and a half.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 As for Cain, when the mourning for his brother was ended, he took his sister Luluwa and married her, without leave from his father and mother; for they could not keep him from her, by reason of their heavy heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 He then went down to the bottom of the mountain, away from the garden, near to the place where he had killed his brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 And in that place were many fruit trees and forest trees. His sister bare him children, who in their turn began to multiply by degrees until they filled that place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>9 But as for Adam and Eve, they came not together after Abel&apos;s funeral, for seven years.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then they prepared an offering and brought it up to the altar, and offered it before the Lord, and began to entreat Him to accept their offering, and to give them a good offspring.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 And God heard Adam and accepted his offering. Then, they worshipped, Adam, Eve, and their daughter, and came down to the Cave of Treasures and placed a lamp in it, to burn by night and by day, before the body of Abel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then Adam and Eve continued fasting and praying until Eve&apos;s time came that she should be delivered, when she said to Adam: &quot;I wish to go to the cave in the rock, to bring forth in it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 And he said, &quot;Go and take with thee thy daughter to wait on thee; but I will remain in this Cave of Treasures before the body of my son Abel.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then Eve was comforted when she saw him, and remained eight days in the cave; then she sent her daughter unto Adam to tell him to come and see the child and name him.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 But when Adam came and saw the child&apos;s good looks, his beauty, and his perfect figure, he rejoiced over him, and was comforted for Abel.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>2 Then Adam arose and went up above the Cave of Treasures; and continued to sleep there night by night. But as soon as it was light every day he came down to the cave, to pray there and to receive a blessing from it.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, when he saw Adam thus alone, fasting and praying, appeared unto him in the form of a beautiful woman, who came and stood before him in the night of the fortieth day, and said unto him:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;O Adam, from the time ye have dwelt in this cave, we have experienced great peace from you, and your prayers have reached us, and we have been comforted about you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;But now, O Adam, that thou hast gone up over the roof of the cave to sleep, we have had doubts about thee, and a great sorrow has come upon us because of thy separation from Eve. Then again, when thou art on the roof of this cave, thy prayer is poured out, and thy heart wanders from side to side.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;But when thou wast in the cave thy prayer was like fire gathered together; it came down to us, and thou didst find rest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;Then I also grieved over thy children who are severed from thee; and my sorrow is great about the murder of thy son Abel; for he was righteous; and over a righteous man every one will grieve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;But I rejoiced over the birth of thy son Seth; yet after a little while I sorrowed greatly over Eve, because she is my sister.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">10 &quot;I rejoiced over my sister for her being with thee.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;And now, lo! God&apos;s promise to me is fulfilled; for it is He who has sent me to thee for the wedding; because if thou wed me, I shall bear thee finer and better children than those of Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 &quot;Then again, thou art as yet but a youth; end not thy youth in this world in sorrow; but spend the days of thy youth in mirth and pleasure.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 Then God sent His Word unto Adam, saying, &quot;O Adam, that figure is the one that promised thee the Godhead, and majesty; he is not favourably disposed towards thee; but shows himself to thee at one time in the form of a woman; another moment, in the likeness of an angel; on another occasions, in the similitude of a serpent; and at another time, in the semblance of a god; but he does all that only to destroy thy soul.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 &quot;Now, therefore, O Adam, understanding thy heart, I have delivered thee many a time from his hands; in order to show thee that I am a merciful God; and that I wish thy good, and that I do not wish thy ruin.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 And God said to Adam, &quot;Look at this devil, and at his hideous look, and know that he it is who made thee fall from brightness into darkness, from peace and rest to toil and misery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And look, O Adam, at him, who said of himself that he is God! Can God be black? Would God take the form of a woman? Is there any one stronger than God? And can He be overpowered?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;See, then, O Adam, and behold him bound in thy presence, in the air, unable to flee away! Therefore, I say unto thee, be not afraid of him; henceforth take care, and beware of him, in whatever he may do to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then God drove Satan away from before Adam, whom He strengthened, and whose heart He comforted, saying to him, &quot;Go down to the Cave of Treasures, and separate not thyself from Eve; I will quell in you all animal lust.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 He also fasted when bringing up his offering every day, more than his father did; for he was of a fair countenance, like unto an angel of God.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>3 And God was pleased with his offering; but He was also pleased with his purity. And he continued thus in doing the will of God, and of his father and mother, until he was seven years old.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 After that, as he was coming down from the altar, having ended his offering, Satan appeared unto him in the form of a beautiful angel, brilliant with light; with a staff of light in his hand, himself girt about with a girdle of light.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 He greeted Seth with a beautiful smile, and began to beguile him with fair words, saying to him, &quot;O Seth, why abidest thou in this mountain?

But all is heat, weariness, and trouble.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 He said further, &quot;But we dwell in beautiful places, in another world than this earth. Our world is one of light and our condition is of the best; our women are handsomer than any others; and I wish thee, O Seth, to wed one of them; because I see that thou art fair to look upon, and in this land there is not one woman good enough for thee. Besides, all those who live in this world, are only five souls.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;Thou shalt remain in our world. and rest from this world and the misery of it; thou shalt never again feel faint and weary; thou shalt never bring up an offering, nor sue for mercy; for thou shalt commit no more sin, nor be swayed by passions.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Seth&apos;s conscience helps him. He returns to Adam and Eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN Seth heard these words he was amazed, and inclined his heart to Satan&apos;s treacherous speech, and said to him, &quot;Saidst thou there is another world created than this; and other creatures more beautiful than the creatures that are in this world?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 And Satan said, &quot;Yes; behold thou hast heard me; but I will yet praise them and their ways, in thy hearing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 But Seth said to him, &quot;Thy speech has amazed me; and thy beautiful description of it all.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 &quot;Yet I cannot go with thee to-day; not until I have gone to my father Adam and to my mother Eve, and told them all thou hast said to me. Then if they give me leave to go with thee, I will come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Again Seth said, &quot;I am afraid of doing any thing without my father&apos;s and mother&apos;s leave, lest I perish like my brother Cain, and like my father Adam, who transgressed the commandment of God. But, behold, thou knowest this place; come, and meet me here to-morrow.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 When Satan heard this, he said to Seth, &quot;If thou tellest thy father Adam what I have told thee, he will not let thee come with me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 But hearken to me; do not tell thy father and mother what I have said to thee; but come with me to-day, to our world; where thou shalt see beautiful things and enjoy thyself there, and revel this day among my children, beholding them and taking thy fill of mirth; and rejoice ever more. Then I shall bring thee back to this place to-morrow; but if thou wouldest rather abide with me, so be it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then Seth answered, &quot;The spirit of my father and of my mother, hangs on me; and if I hide from them one day, they will die, and God will hold me guilty of sinning against them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>9 &quot;And except that they know I am come to this place to bring up to it my offering, they would not be separated from me one hour; neither should I go to any other place, unless they let me. But they treat me most kindly, because I come back to them quickly.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then Satan said to him, &quot;What will happen to thee if thou hide thyself from them one night, and return to them at break of day?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 But Seth, when he saw how he kept on talking, and that he would not leave him-ran, and went up to the altar, and spread his hands unto God, and sought deliverance from Him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then God sent His Word, and cursed Satan, who fled from Him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 But as for Seth, he had gone up to the altar, saying thus in his heart. &quot;The altar is the place of offering, and God is there; a divine fire shall consume it; so shall Satan be unable to hurt me, and shall not take me away thence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then Seth came down from the altar and went to his father and mother, where he found in the way, longing to hear his voice; for he had tarried a while.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 He then began to tell them what had befallen him from Satan, under the form of an angel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 But when Adam heard his account, he kissed his face, and warned him against that angel, telling him it was Satan who thus appeared to him. Then Adam took Seth, and they went to the Cave of Treasures, and rejoiced therein.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 But from that day forth Adam and Eve never parted from him, to whatever place he might go, whether for his offering or for any thing else.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 This sign happened to Seth, when he was nine years old.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 So Adam said to his son Seth, &quot;I wish, O my son, that thou wed thy sister Aklia, Abel&apos;s sister, that she may bear thee children, who shall replenish the earth, according to God&apos;s promise to us.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 &quot;Be not afraid, O my son; there is no disgrace in it. I wish thee to marry, from fear lest the enemy overcome thee.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>2 &quot;O Seth, my son bring me thy children and thy children&apos;s children, that I may shed my blessing on them ere I die.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 When Seth heard these words from his father Adam, he went from him, shed a flood of tears over his face, and gathered together his children and his children&apos;s children, and brought them to his father Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But when our father Adam saw them around him, he wept at having to be separated from them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 And when they saw him weeping, they all wept together, and fell upon his face saying, &quot;How shalt thou be severed from us, O our father? And how shall the earth receive thee and hide thee from our eyes?&quot; Thus did they lament much, and in like words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then our father Adam blessed them all, and said to Seth, after he had blessed them:--</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;O Seth, my son, thou knowest this world--that it is full of sorrow, and of weariness; and thou knowest all that has come upon us, from our trials in it. ]I therefore now command thee in these words: to keep innocency, to be pure and just, and trusting in God; and lean not to the discourses of Satan, nor to the apparitions in which he will show himself to thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But keep the commandments that I give thee this day; then give the same to thy son Enos; and let Enos give it to his son Cainan; and Cainan to his son Mahalaleel; so that this commandment abide firm among all your children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 &quot;O Seth, my son, the moment I am dead take ye my body and wind it up with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, and leave me here in this Cave of Treasures in which are all these tokens which God gave us from the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;O my son, hereafter shall a flood come and overwhelm all creatures, and leave out only eight souls.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">11 &quot;But, O my son, let those whom it will leave out from among your children at that time, take my body with them out of this cave; and when they have taken it with </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">them, let the oldest among them command his children to lay my body in a ship until the flood has been assuaged, and they come out of the ship.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then they shall take my body and lay it in the middle of the earth, shortly after they have been saved from the waters of the flood.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 &quot;For the place where my body shall be laid, is the middle of the earth; God shall come from thence and shall save all our kindred.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 &quot;But now, O Seth, my son, place thyself at the head of thy people; tend them and watch over them in the fear of God; and lead them in the good way, Command them to fast unto God; and make them understand they ought not to hearken to Satan, lest he destroy them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 &quot;Then, again, sever thy children and thy children&apos;s children from Cain&apos;s children; do not let them ever mix with those, nor come near them either in their words or in their deeds.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 Then Adam let his blessing descend upon Seth, and upon his children, and upon all his children&apos;s children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 He then turned to his son Seth, and to Eve his wife, and said to them, &quot;Preserve this gold, this incense, and this myrrh, that God has given us for a sign; for in days that are coming, a flood will overwhelm the whole creation. But those who shall go into the ark shall take with them the gold, the incense, and the myrrh, together with my body; and will lay the gold, the incense, and the myrrh, with my body in the midst of the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 &quot;Then, after a long time, the city in which the gold, the incense, and the myrrh are found with my body, shall be plundered.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 &quot;And now, O Seth, my son, behold I have revealed unto thee hidden mysteries, which God had revealed unto me. Keep my commandment, for thyself, and for thy people,&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN Adam had ended his commandment to Seth, his limbs were loosened, his hands and feet lost all power, his mouth became dumb, and his tongue ceased altogether to speak. He closed his eyes and gave up the ghost.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But when his children saw that he was dead, they threw themselves over him, men and women, old and young, weeping.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 The death of Adam took place at the end of nine hundred and thirty years that be lived upon the earth; on the fifteenth day of Barmudeh, after the reckoning of an epact of the sun, at the ninth hour.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 It was on a Friday, the very day on which be was created, and on which he rested; and the hour at which he died, was the same as that at which he came out of the garden.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Seth wound him up well, and embalmed him with plenty of sweet spices, from sacred trees and from the Holy Mountain; and be laid his body on the eastern side of the inside of the cave, the side of the incense; and placed in front of him a lamp-stand kept burning.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then his children stood before him weeping and wailing over him the whole night until break of day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>7 Then Seth and big son Enos, and Cainan, the son of Enos, went out and took good offerings to present unto the Lord, and they came to the altar upon which Adam offered gifts to God, when he did offer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But Eve said to them &quot;Wait until we have first asked God to accept our offering, and to keep by Him the Soul of Adam His servant, and to take it up to rest.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And they all stood up an prayed.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">&quot;Adam was the first....&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AND when they had ended their prayer, the Word of God came and comforted them concerning their father Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 After this, they offered their gifts for themselves and for their father.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And when they had ended their offering, the Word of God came to Seth, the eldest among them, saying unto him, &quot;O Seth, Seth, Seth, three times.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But as to thy father Adam, keep thou the commandment he gave thee; and sever thy seed from that of Cain thy brother.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 And God withdrew His Word from Seth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then Seth, Eve, and their children, came down from the mountain to the Cave of Treasures.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 But Adam was the first whose soul died in the land of Eden, in the Cave of Treasures; for no one died before him, but his son Abel, who died murdered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then all the children of Adam rose up, and wept over their father Adam, and made offerings to him, one hundred and forty days.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Seth becomes head of the most happy and just tribe of people who ever lived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AFTER the death of Adam and of Eve, Seth severed his children, and his children&apos;s children, from Cain&apos;s children. Cain and his seed went down and dwelt westward, below the place where he had killed his brother Abel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But Seth and his children, dwelt northwards upon the mountain of the Cave of Treasures, in order to be near to their father Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And Seth the elder, tall and good, with a fine soul, and of a strong mind, stood at the head of his people; and tended them in innocence, penitence, and meekness, and did not allow one of them to go down to Cain&apos;s children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But because of their own purity, they were named &quot;Children of God,&quot; and they were with God, instead of the hosts of angels who fell; for they continued in praises to God, and in singing psalms unto Him, in their cave--the Cave of Treasures.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Then Seth stood before the body of his father Adam, and of his mother Eve, and prayed night and day, and asked for mercy towards himself and his children; and that when he had some difficult dealing with a child, He would give him counsel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 But Seth and his children did not like earthly work, but gave themselves to heavenly things; for they had no other thought than praises, doxologies, and psalms unto God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Therefore did they at all times hear the voices of angels, praising and glorifying God; from within the garden, or when they were sent by God on an errand, or when they were going up to heaven.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 For Seth and his children, by reason of their own purity, heard and saw those angels. Then, again, the garden was not far above them, but only some fifteen spiritual cubits</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Now one spiritual cubit answers to three cubits of man, altogether forty-five cubits.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>10 Seth and his children dwelt on the mountain below the garden; they sowed not, neither did they reap; they wrought no food for the body. not even wheat; but only offerings. They ate of the fruit and of trees well flavoured that grew on the mountain where they dwelt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Then Seth often fasted every forty days, as did also his eldest children. For the family of Seth smelled the smell of the trees in the garden, when the wind blew that way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 They were happy, innocent, without sudden fear, there was no jealousy, no evil action, no hatred among them. There was no animal passion; from no mouth among them went forth either foul words or curse; neither evil counsel nor fraud. For the men of that time never swore, but under hard circumstances, when men must swear, they swore by the blood of Abel the just.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 But they constrained their children and their women every day in the cave to fast and pray, and to worship the most High God. They blessed themselves n the body of their father Adam, and anointed themselves with it.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 &quot;As my end is near, I wish to build a roof over the altar on which gifts are offered.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 They hearkened to his commandment and went out, all of them, both old and young, and worked hard at it, and built a beautiful roof over the altar.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 And Seth&apos;s thought in so doing, was that a blessing should come upon his children on the mountain; and that he should present an offering for them before his death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 Then when the building of the roof was completed, he commanded them to make offerings.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 And God accepted his offering, and sent His blessing upon him and upon his children. And then God made a promise to Seth, saying, &quot;At the end of the great five days and a half, concerning which I have made a promise to thee and to thy father, I will send My Word and save thee and thy seed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then Seth and his children, and his children&apos;s children, met together, and came down from the altar, and went to the Cave of Treasures--where they prayed, and blessed themselves in the body of our father Adam, and anointed themselves with it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 But Seth abode in the Cave of Treasures, a few days, and then suffered--sufferings unto death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then Enos, his first-born son, came to him, with Cainan, his son, and Mahalaleel, Cainan&apos;s son, and Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, and Enoch, Jared&apos;s son, with their wives and children to receive a blessing from Seth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then Seth prayed over them, and blessed them, and adjured them by the blood of Abel the just, saying, &quot;I beg of you, my children, not to let one of you go down from this Holy and pure Mountain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Make no fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer and the sinner, who killed his brother; for ye know, O my children, that we flee from him, and from all his sin with all our might because he killed his brother Abel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 After having said this, Seth blessed Enos, his first-born son, and commanded him habitually to minister in purity before the body of our father Adam, all the days of his life; then, also, to go at times to the altar which he Seth had built. And he commanded him to feed his people in righteousness, in judgment and purity all the days of his life.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then they wound up carefully the body of Seth, and embalmed him with sweet spices, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures, on the right side of our father Adam&apos;s body, and they mourned for him forty days. They offered gifts for him, as they had done for our father Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 After the death of Seth Enos rose at the head of his people, whom he fed in righteousness, and judgment, as his father had commanded him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 But by the time Enos was eight hundred and twenty years old, Cain had a large progeny; for they married frequently, being given to animal lusts; until the land below the mountain, was filled with them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 And Lamech said to him, &quot;Make me understand which way he looks, when he comes up.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then Lamech bent his bow, placed an arrow on it, and fitted a stone in the sling, and when Cain came out from the open country, the shepherd said to Lamech, &quot;Shoot, behold, he is coming.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Then Lamech shot at Cain with his arrow and hit him in his side. And Lamech struck him with a stone from his sling, that fell upon his face, and knocked out both his eyes; then Cain fell at once and died.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then Lamech and the young shepherd came up to him, and found him lying on the ground. And the young shepherd said to him, &quot;It is Cain our grandfather, whom thou hast killed, O my lord!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then was Lamech sorry for it, and from the bitterness of his regret, he clapped his hands together, and struck with his flat palm the head of the youth, who fell as if dead; but Lamech thought it was a feint; so he took up a stone and smote him, and smashed his head until he died.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">WHEN Enos was nine hundred years old, all the children of Seth, and of Cainan, and his first-born, with their wives and children, gathered around him, asking for a blessing from him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 He then prayed over them and blessed them, and adjured them by the blood of Abel the just saying to them, &quot;Let not one of your children go down from this Holy Mountain, and let them make no fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then Enos called his son Cainan and said to him, &quot;See, O my son, and set thy heart on thy people, and establish them in righteousness, and in innocence; and stand ministering before the body of our father Adam, all the days of thy life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 After this Enos entered into rest, aged nine hundred and eighty-five years; and Cainan wound him up, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures on the left of his father Adam; and made offerings for him, after the custom of his fathers.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AFTER the death of Enos, Cainan stood at the head of his people in righteousness and innocence, as his father had commanded him; he also continued to minister before the body of Adam, inside the Cave of Treasures.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then when he had lived nine hundred and ten years, suffering and affliction came upon him. And when he was about to enter into rest, all the fathers with their wives and children came to him, and he blessed them, and adjured them by the blood of Abel, the just, saying to them, &quot;Let not one among you go down from this Holy Mountain; and make no fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Mahalaleel, his first-born son, received this commandment from his father, who blessed him and died.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>4 Then Mahalaleel embalmed him with sweet spices, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures, with his fathers; and they made offerings for him, after the custom of their fathers.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Mahalaleel stood over his people, and fed them in righteousness and innocence, and watched them to see they held no intercourse with the children of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 He also continued in the Cave of Treasures praying and ministering before the body of our father Adam, asking God for mercy on himself and on his people; until he was eight hundred and seventy years old, when he fell sick.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then all his children gathered unto him, to see him, and to ask for his blessing on them all, ere he left this world.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then Mahalaleel arose and sat on his bed, his tears streaming down his face, and he called his eldest son Jared, who came to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 He then kissed his face, and said to him, &quot;O Jared, my son, I adjure thee by Him who made heaven and earth, to watch over thy people, and to feed them in righteousness and in innocence; and not to let one of them go down from this Holy Mountain to the children of Cain, lest he perish with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;Hear, O my son, hereafter there shall come a great destruction upon this earth on account of them; God will be angry with the world, and will destroy them with waters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;But I also know that thy children will not hearken to thee, and that they will go down from this mountain and hold intercourse with the children of Cain, and that they shall perish with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;O my son! teach them, and watch over them, that no guilt attach to thee on their account.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>9 Mahalaleel said, moreover, to his son Jared, &quot;When I die, embalm my body and lay it in the Cave of Treasures, by the bodies of my fathers; then stand thou by my body and pray to God; and take care of them, and fulfil thy ministry before them, until thou enterest into rest thyself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Mahalaleel then blessed all his children; and then lay down on his bed, and entered into rest like his fathers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 But when Jared saw that his father Mahalaleel was dead, he wept, and sorrowed, and embraced and kissed his hands and his feet; and so did all his children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 And his children embalmed him carefully, and laid him by the bodies of his fathers. Then they arose, and mourned for him forty days.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Jared turns martinet. He is lured away to the land of Cain where he sees many voluptuous sights. Jared barely escapes with a clean heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THEN Jared kept his father&apos;s commandment, and arose like a lion over his people. He fed them in righteousness and innocence, and commanded them to do nothing without his counsel. For he was afraid concerning them, lest they should go to the children of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Wherefore did he give them orders repeatedly; and continued to do so until the end of the four hundred and eighty-fifth year of his life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 At the end of these said years, there came unto him this sign. As Jared was standing like a lion before the bodies of his fathers, praying and warning his people, Satan envied him, and wrought a beautiful apparition, because Jared would not let his children do aught without his counsel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Satan then appeared to him with thirty men of his hosts, in the form of handsome men; Satan himself being the elder and tallest among them, with a fine beard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 They stood at the mouth of the cave, and called out Jared, from within it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>6 He came out to them, and found them looking like fine men, full of light, and of great beauty. He wondered at their beauty and at their looks; and thought within himself whether they might not be of the children of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 He said also in his heart, &quot;As the children of Cain cannot come up to the height of this mountain, and none of them is so handsome as these appear to be; and among these men there is not one of my kindred--they must be strangers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then Jared and they exchanged a greeting and he said to the elder among them, &quot;O my father, explain to me the wonder that is in thee, and tell me who these are, with thee; for they look to me like strange men.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then the elder began to weep, and the rest wept with him; and he said to Jared: &quot;I am Adam whom God made first; and this is Abel my son, who was killed by his brother Cain, into whose heart Satan put to murder him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 &quot;Then this is my son Seth, whom I asked of the Lord, who gave him to me, to comfort me instead of Abel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Then this one is my son Enos, son of Seth, and that other one is Cainan, son of Enos, and that other one is Mahalaleel, son of Cainan, thy father.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 But Jared remained wondering at their appearance, and at the speech of the elder to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then the elder said to him, &quot;Marvel not, O my son; we live in the land north of the garden, which God created before the world. He would not let us live there, but placed us inside the garden, below which ye are now dwelling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 &quot;But after that I transgressed, He made me come out of it, and I was left to dwell in this cave; great and sore troubles came upon me; and when my death drew near, I commanded my son Seth to tend his people well; and this my commandment is to be handed from one to another, unto the end of the generations to come.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 &quot;But, O Jared, my son, we live in beautiful regions, while you live here in misery, as this thy father Mahalaleel informed me; telling me that a great flood will come and overwhelm the whole earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>16 &quot;Therefore, O my son, fearing for your sakes, I rose and took my children with me, and came hither for us to visit thee and thy children; but I found thee standing in this cave weeping, and thy children scattered about this mountain, in the heat and in misery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 &quot;But, O my son, as we missed our way, and came as far as this, we found other men below this mountain; who inhabit a beautiful country, full of trees and of fruits, and of all manner of verdure; it is like a garden; so that when we found them we thought they were you; until thy father Mahalaleel told me they were no such thing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 &quot;Now, therefore, O my son, hearken to my counsel, and go down to them, thou and thy children. Ye will rest from all this suffering in which ye are. But if thou wilt not go down to them, then, arise, take thy children, and come with us to our garden; ye shall live in our beautiful land, and ye shall rest from all this trouble, which thou and thy children are now bearing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 But Jared when he heard this discourse from the elder, wondered; and went hither and thither, but at that moment he found not one of his children.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Then he answered and said to the elder, &quot;Why have you hidden yourselves until this day?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 And the elder replied, &quot;If thy father had not told us, we should not have known it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">22 Then Jared believed his words were true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 So that elder said to Jared, &quot;Wherefore didst thou turn about, so and so?&quot; And he said, &quot;I was seeking one of my children, to tell him about my going with you, and about their coming down to those about whom thou hast spoken to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 When the elder heard Jared&apos;s intention, he said to him, &quot;Let alone that purpose at present, and come with us; thou shalt see our country; if the land in which we dwell pleases thee, we and thou shall return hither and take thy family with us. But if our country does not please thee, thou shalt come back to thine own place.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">25 And the elder urged Jared, to go before one of his children came to counsel him otherwise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>26 Jared, then, came out of the cave and went with them, and among them. And they comforted him, until they came to the top of the mountain of the sons of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">27 Then said the elder to one of his companions, &quot;We have forgotten something by the mouth of the cave, and that is the chosen garment we had brought to clothe Jared withal.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">28 He then said to one of them, &quot;Go back, thou, some one; and we will wait for thee here, until thou come back. Then will we clothe Jared and he shall be like us, good, handsome, and fit to come with us into our country.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">29 Then that one went back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">30 But when he was a short distance off, the elder called to him and said to him, &quot;Tarry thou, until I come up and speak to thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">31 Then he stood still, and the elder went up to him and said to him, &quot;One thing we forgot at the cave, it is this--to put out the lamp that burns inside it, above the bodies that are therein. Then come back to us, quick.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">32 That one went, and the elder came back to his fellows and to Jared. And they came down from the mountain, and Jared with them; and they stayed by a fountain of water, near the houses of the children of Cain, and waited for their companion until he brought the garment for Jared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">33 He, then, who went, back to the cave, put out the lamp, and came to them and brought a phantom with him and showed it them. And when Jared saw it he wondered at the beauty and grace thereof, and rejoiced in his heart believing it was all true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">34 But while they were staying there, three of them went into houses of the sons of Cain, and said to them, &quot;Bring us to-day some food by the fountain of water, for us and our companions to eat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">35 But when the sons of Cain saw them, they wondered at them and thought: &quot;These are beautiful to look at, and such as we never saw before.&quot; So they rose and came with them to the fountain of water, to see their companions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>36 They found them so very handsome, that they cried aloud about their places for others to gather together and come and look at these beautiful beings. Then they gathered around them both men and women.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">37 Then the elder said to them, &quot;We are strangers in your land, bring us some good food and drink you and your women, to refresh ourselves with you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">38 When those men heard these words of the elder, every one of Cain&apos;s sons brought his wife, and another brought his daughter, and so, many women came to them; every one addressing Jared either for himself or for his wife; all alike.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">39 But when Jared saw what they did, his very soul wrenched itself from them; neither would he taste of their food or of their drink.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">40 The elder saw hint as he wrenched himself from them, and said to him, &quot;Be not sad; I am the great elder, as thou shalt see me do, do thyself in like manner.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">41 Then he spread his hands and took one of the women, and five of his companions did the same before Jared, that he should do as they did.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">42 But when Jared saw them working infamy he wept, and said in his mind,--My fathers never did the like.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">43 He then spread his hands and prayed with a fervent heart, and with much weeping, and entreated God to deliver him from their hands.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">44 No sooner did Jared begin to pray than the elder fled with his companions; for they could not abide in a place of prayer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">45 Then Jared turned round but could not see them, but found himself standing in the midst of the children of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">46 He then wept and said, &quot;O God, destroy me not with this race, concerning which my fathers have warned me; for now, O my Lord God, I was thinking that those who appeared unto me were my fathers; but I have found them out to be devils, who allured me by this beautiful apparition, until I believed them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>47 &quot;But now I ask Thee, O God, to deliver me from this race, among whom I am now staying, as Thou didst deliver me from those devils. Send Thy angel to draw me out of the midst of them; for I have not myself power to escape from among them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">48 When Jared had ended his prayer, God sent His angel in the midst of them, who took Jared and set him upon the mountain, and showed him the way, gave him counsel, and then departed from him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">Confusion in the Cave of Treasures. Miraculous speech of the dead Adam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">THE children of Jared were in the habit of visiting him hour after hour, to receive his blessing and to ask his advice for every thing they did; and when he had a work to do, they did it for him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But this time when they went into the cave they found not Jared, but they found the lamp put out, and the bodies of the fathers thrown about, and voices came from them by the power of God, that said, &quot;Satan in an apparition has deceived our son, wishing to destroy him, as he destroyed our son Cain.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 They said also, &quot;Lord God of heaven and earth, deliver our son from the hand of Satan, who wrought a great and false apparition before him,&quot; They also spake of other matters, by the power of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But when the children of Jared heard these voices they feared, and stood weeping for their father; for they knew not what had befallen him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 And they wept for him that day until the setting of the sun.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then came Jared with a woeful countenance, wretched in mind and body, and sorrowful at having been separated from the bodies of his fathers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">7 But as he was drawing near to the cave, his children saw him, and hastened to the cave, and hung upon his neck, crying, and saying to him, &quot;O father, where hast thou been, and why hast thou left us, as thou wast not wont to do?&quot; And again, &quot;O father, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">when thou didst disappear, the lamp over the bodies of our fathers went out, the bodies were thrown about, and voices came from them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 When Jared heard this he was sorry, and went into the cave; and there found the bodies thrown about, the lamp put out, and the fathers themselves praying for his deliverance from the hand of Satan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then Jared fell upon the bodies and embraced them, and said, &quot;O my fathers, through your intercession, let God deliver me from the hand of Satan! And I beg you will ask God to keep me and to bide me from him unto the day of my death.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then all the voices ceased save the voice of our father Adam, who spake to Jared by the power of God, just as one would speak to his fellow, saying, &quot;O Jared, my son, offer gifts to God for having delivered thee from the hand of Satan; and when thou bringest those offerings, so be it that thou offerest them on the altar on which I did offer. Then also, beware of Satan; for he deluded me many a time with his apparitions, wishing to destroy me, but God delivered me out of his hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;Command thy people that they be on their guard against him; and never cease to offer up gifts to God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then the voice of Adam also became silent; and Jared and his children wondered at this. Then they laid the bodies as they were it first; and Jared and his children stood praying the whole of that night, until break of day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 Then Jared made an offering and offered it up on the altar, as Adam had commanded him. And as he went up to the altar, he prayed to God for mercy and for forgiveness of his sin, concerning the lamp going out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 Then God appeared unto Jared on the altar and blessed him and his children, and accepted their offerings; and commanded Jared to take of the sacred fire from the altar, and with it to light the lamp that shed light on the body of Adam.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P36">The children of Jared are led astray.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>THEN God revealed to him again the promise He had made to Adam; He explained to him the 5500 years, and revealed unto him the mystery of His coming upon the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 And God said to Jared, &quot;As to that fire which thou hast taken from the altar to light the lamp withal, let it abide with you to give light to the bodies; and let it not come out of the cave, until the body of Adam comes out of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 But, O Jared, take care of the fire, that it burn bright in the lamp; neither go thou again out of the cave, until thou receivest an order through a vision, and not in an apparition, when seen by thee.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 &quot;Then command again thy people not to hold intercourse with the children of Cain, and not to learn their ways; for I am God who loves not hatred and works of iniquity.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 God gave also many other commandments to Jared, and blessed him. And then withdrew His Word from him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Then Jared drew near with his children, took some fire, and came down to the cave, and lighted the lamp before the body of Adam; and he gave his people commandments as God had told him to do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 This sign happened to Jared at the end of his four hundred and fiftieth year; as did also many other wonders, we do not record. But we record only this one for shortness sake, and in order not to lengthen our narrative.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 And Jared continued to teach his children eighty years; but after that they began to transgress the commandments he had given them, and to do many things without his counsel. They began to go down from the Holy Mountain one after another, and to mix with the children of Cain, in foul fellowships.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Now the reason for which the children of Jared went down the Holy Mountain, is this, that we will now reveal unto you.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AFTER Cain had gone down to the land of dark soil, and his children had multiplied therein, there was one of them, whose name was Genun, son of Lamech the blind who slew Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 But as to this Genun, Satan came into him in his childhood; and he made sundry trumpets and horns, and string instruments, cymbals and psalteries, and lyres and harps, and flutes; and he played on them at all times and at every hour.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 And when he played on them, Satan came into them, so that from among them were heard beautiful and sweet sounds, that ravished the heart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Then he gathered companies upon companies to play on them; and when they played, it pleased well the children of Cain, who inflamed themselves with sin among themselves, and burnt as with fire; while Satan inflamed their hearts, one with another, and increased lust among them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 Satan also taught Genun to bring strong drink out of com; and this Genun used to bring together companies upon companies in drink-houses; and brought into their hands all manner of fruits and flowers; and they drank together.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 Thus did this Genun multiply sin exceedingly; he also acted with pride, and taught the children of Cain to commit all manner of the grossest wickedness, which they knew not; and put them up to manifold doings which they knew not before.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Then Satan, when he saw that they yielded to Genun and hearkened to him in every thing he told them, rejoiced greatly, increased Genun&apos;s understanding, until he took iron and with it made weapons of war.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 Then when they were drunk, hatred and murder increased among them; one man used violence against another to teach him evil taking his children and defiling them before him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>9 And when men saw they were overcome, and saw others that were not overpowered, those who were beaten came to Genun, took refuge with him, and he made them his confederates.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Then sin increased among them greatly; until a man married his own sister, or daughter, or mother, and others; or the daughter of his father&apos;s sister, so that there was no more distinction of relationship, and they no longer knew what is iniquity; but did wickedly, and the earth was defiled with sin, and they angered God the Judge, who had created them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 But Genun gathered together companies upon companies, that played on horns and on all the other instruments we have already mentioned, at the foot of the Holy Mountain; and they did so in order that the children of Seth who were on the Holy Mountain should hear it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 But when the children of Seth heard the noise, they wondered, and came by companies, and stood on the top of the mountain to look at those below; and they did thus a whole year.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 When, at the end of that year, Genun saw that they were being won over to him little by little, Satan entered into him, and taught him to make dyeing-stuffs for garments of divers patterns, and made him understand how to dye crimson and purple and what not.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 And the sons of Cain who wrought all this, and shone in beauty and gorgeous apparel, gathered together at the foot of the mountain in splendour, with horns and gorgeous dresses, and horse races, committing all manner of abominations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 Meanwhile the children of Seth, who were on the Holy Mountain, prayed and praised God, in the place of the hosts of angels who had fallen; wherefore God had called them &quot;angels,&quot; because He rejoiced over them greatly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">16 But after this, they no longer kept His commandment, nor held by the promise He had made to their fathers; but they relaxed from their fasting and praying, and from the counsel of Jared their father. And they kept on gathering together on the top of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the mountain, to look upon the children of Cain, from morning until evening, and upon what they did, upon their beautiful dresses and ornaments.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">17 Then the children of Cain looked up from below, and saw the children of Seth, standing in troops on the top of the mountain; and they called to them to come down to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">18 But the children of Seth said to them from above, &quot;We don&apos;t know the way.&quot; Then Genun, the son of Lamech, heard them say they did not know the way, and he bethought himself how he might bring them down.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">19 Then Satan appeared to him by night, saying, &quot;There is no way for them to come down from the mountain on which they dwell; but when they come to-morrow, say to them, &apos;Come ye to the western side of the mountain; there you will find the way of a stream of water, that comes down to the foot of the mountain, between two hills; come down that way to us.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 Then when it was day, Genun blew the horns and beat the drums below the mountain, as he was wont. The children of Seth heard it, and came as they used to do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">21 Then Genun said to them from down below, &quot;Go to the western side of the mountain, there you will find the way to come down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">22 But when the children of Seth heard these words from him, they went back into the cave to Jared, to tell him all they had heard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 Then when Jared heard it, he was grieved; for he knew that they would transgress his counsel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">24 After this a hundred men of the children of Seth gathered together, and said among themselves, &quot;Come, let us go down to the children of Cain, and see what they do, and enjoy ourselves with them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">25 But when Jared heard this of the hundred men, his very soul was moved, and his heart was grieved. He then arose with great fervour, and stood in the midst of them, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and adjured them by the blood of Abel the just, &quot;Let not one of you go down from this holy and pure mountain, in which our fathers have ordered its to dwell.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">26 But when Jared saw that they did not receive his words, he said unto them, &quot;O my good and innocent and holy children, know that when once you go down from this holy mountain, God will not allow you to return again to it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">27 He again adjured them, saying, &quot;I adjure by the death of our father Adam, and by the blood of Abel, of Seth, of Enos, of Cainan, and of Mahalaleel, to hearken to me, and not to go down from this holy mountain; for the moment you leave it, you will be reft of life and of mercy; and you shall no longer be called &apos;children of God,&apos; but &apos;children of the devil.&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">28 But they would not hearken to his words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">29 Enoch at that time was already grown up, and in his zeal for God, be arose and said, &quot;Hear me, O ye sons of Seth, small and great--when ye transgress the commandment of our fathers, and go down from this holy mountain--ye shall not come up hither again for ever.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">30 But they rose up against Enoch, and would not hearken to his words, but went down from the Holy Mountain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">31 And when they looked at the daughters of Cain, at their beautiful figures, and at their hands and feet dyed with colour, and tattooed in ornaments on their faces, the fire of sin was kindled in them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">32 Then Satan made them look most beautiful before the sons of Seth, as he also made the sons of Seth appear of the fairest in the eyes of the daughters of Cain, so that the daughters of Cain lusted after the sons of Seth like ravenous beasts, and the sons of Seth after the daughters of Cain, until they committed abomination with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">33 But after they had thus fallen into this defilement, they returned by the way they had come, and tried to ascend the Holy Mountain. But they could not, because the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">stones of that holy mountain were of fire flashing before them, by reason of which they could not go up again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">34 And God was angry with them, and repented of them because they had come down from glory, and had thereby lost or forsaken their own purity or innocence, and were fallen into the defilement of sin.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">35 Then God sent His Word to Jared, saying, &quot;These thy children, whom thou didst call &apos;My children,&apos;--behold they have transgressed My commandment, and have gone down to the abode of perdition, and of sin. Send a messenger to those that are left, that they may not go down, and be lost.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">36 Then Jared wept before the Lord, and asked of Him mercy and forgiveness. But he wished that his soul might depart from his body, rather than hear these words from God about the going down of his children from the Holy Mountain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">37 But he followed God&apos;s order, and preached unto them not to go down from that holy mountain, and not to hold intercourse with the children of Cain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">38 But they heeded not his message, and would not obey his counsel.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">AFTER this another company gathered together, and they went to look after their brethren; but they perished as well as they. And so it was, company after company, until only a few of them were left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 Then Jared sickened from grief, and his sickness was such that the day of his death drew near.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then he called Enoch his eldest son, and Methuselah Enoch&apos;s son, and Lamech the son of Methuselah, and Noah the son of Lamech.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">4 And when they were come to him he prayed over them and blessed them, and said to them, &quot;Ye are righteous, innocent sons; go ye not down from this holy mountain; </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">for behold, your children and your children&apos;s children have gone down from this holy mountain, and have estranged themselves from this holy mountain, through their abominable lust and transgression of God&apos;s commandment.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">5 &quot;But I know, through the power of God, that He will not leave you on this holy mountain, because your children have transgressed His commandment and that of our fathers, which we had received from them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">6 &quot;But, O my sons, God will take you to a strange land, and ye never shall again return to behold with your eyes this garden and this holy mountain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 &quot;Therefore, O my sons, set your hearts on your own selves, and keep the commandment of God which is with you. And when you go from this holy mountain, into a strange land which ye know not, take with you the body of our father Adam, and with it these three precious, gifts and offerings, namely, the gold, the incense, and the myrrh; and let them be in the place where the body of our father Adam shall lay.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 &quot;And unto him of you who shall be left, O my sons, shall the Word of God come, and when he goes out of this land he shall take with him the body of our father Adam, and shall lay it in the middle of the earth the place in which salvation shall be wrought.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Then Noah said unto him, &quot;Who is he of us that shall be left?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 And Jared answered, &quot;Thou art he that shall be left. And thou shalt take the body of our father Adam from the cave, and place it with thee in the ark when the flood comes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 &quot;And thy son Shem, who shall come out of thy loins, he it is who shall lay the body of our father Adam in the middle of the earth, in the place whence salvation shall come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">12 Then Jared turned to his son Enoch, and said unto him, &quot;Thou, my son, abide in this cave, and minister diligently before the body of our father Adam all the days of thy life; and feed thy people in righteousness and innocence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>13 And Jared said no more. His hands were loosened, his eyes closed, and he entered into rest like his fathers.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">14 But as Jared died, tears streamed down his face by reason of his great sorrow, for the children of Seth, who had fallen in his days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">15 Then Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Noah, these four, wept over him; embalmed him carefully, and then laid him in the Cave of Treasures. Then they rose and mourned for him forty days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">16 And when these days of mourning were ended, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Noah remained in sorrow of heart, because their father had departed from them, and they saw him no more.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">2 It is this Enoch to whom many wonders happened, and who also wrote a celebrated book; but those wonders may not be told in this place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Then after this, the children of Seth went astray and fell, they, their children and their wives.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 Enoch continued in his ministry before the Lord three hundred and eighty-five years, and at the end of that time he became aware through the grace of God, that God intended to remove him from the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>5 He then said to his son, &quot;O my son, I know that God intends to bring the waters of the Flood upon the earth, and to destroy our creation.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">7 Enoch said also to them, &quot;Watch over your souls, and hold fast by your fear of God and by your service of Him, and worship Him in upright faith, and serve Him in righteousness, innocence and judgment, in repentance and also in purity.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 When Enoch had ended his commandments to them, God transported him from that mountain to the land of life, to the mansions of the righteous and of the chosen, the abode of Paradise of joy, in light that reaches up to heaven; light that is outside the light of this world; for it is the light of God, that fills the whole world, but which no place can contain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 Thus, because Enoch was in the light of God, he found himself out of the reach of death; until God would have him die.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">10 Altogether, not one of our fathers or of their children, remained on that holy mountain, except those three, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah.

Hevel kept sheep, while Kayin worked the soil. 3 In the course of time Kayin brought an offering to Adonai from the produce of the soil; 4 and Hevel too brought from the firstborn of his sheep, including their fat. Adonai </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">accepted Hevel and his offering 5 but did not accept Kayin and his offering. Kayin was very angry, and his face fell. 6 Adonai said to Kayin, “Why are you angry? Why so downcast? 7 If you are doing what is good, shouldn’t you hold your head high? And if you don’t do what is good, sin is crouching at the door — it wants you, but you can rule over it.” 8 Kayin had words with Hevel his brother; then one time, when they were in the field, Kayin turned on Hevel his brother and killed him.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P22">9 Adonai said to Kayin, “Where is Hevel your brother?” And he replied, “I don’t know; am I my brother’s guardian?” 10 He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground! 11 Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood at your hands. 12 When you farm the ground it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive, wandering the earth.” 13 Kayin said to Adonai, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 You are banning me today from the land and from your presence. I will be a fugitive wandering the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” 15 Adonai answered him, “Therefore, whoever kills Kayin will receive vengeance sevenfold,” and Adonai put a sign on Kayin, so that no one who found him would kill him. 16 So Kayin left the presence of Adonai and lived in the land of Nod [wandering], east of ‘Eden.</text:p>

And these places have been made to receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period (till the period appointed), till the great judgement (comes) upon them.&apos; 5.

   <text:p text:style-name="P22">1. In the year five hundred, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the life of Enoch. In that Parable I saw how a mighty quaking made the heaven of heavens to quake, and the host of the Most High, and the angels, a thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, were disquieted with a great disquiet. 2. And the Head of Days sat on the throne of His glory, and the angels and the righteous stood around Him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">3. And a great trembling seized me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">And fear took hold of me,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">And my loins gave way,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">And dissolved were my reins,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">And I fell upon my face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">4 And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up, and when he had raised me up my spirit returned; for I had not been able to endure the look of this host, and the commotion and the quaking of the heaven. And Michael said to me: &apos;Why art you disquieted with such a vision? Until this day lasted the day of His mercy; and He hath been merciful and long-suffering towards those who dwell on the earth. 6. And when the day, and the power, and the punishment, and the judgement come, which the Lord of Spirits hath prepared for those who worship not the righteous law, and for those who deny the righteous judgement, and for those who take His name in vain--that day is prepared, for the elect a covenant, but for sinners an inquisition.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:span text:style-name="T15">25. When the punishment of the Lord of Spirits shall rest upon them, it shall rest in order that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come, in vain, and it shall </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">slay the children with their mothers and the children with their fathers. Afterwards the judgement shall take place according to His mercy and His patience.&apos;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">7. And on that day two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the abysses of the ocean over the fountains of the waters. 8. But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied with his breast a waste wilderness named Dûidâin, on the east of the garden where the elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of Spirits created. 9. And I besought the other angel that he should show me the might of those monsters, how they were parted on one day and cast, the one into the abysses of the sea, and the other unto the dry land of the wilderness. 10. And he said to me: &apos;you son of man, herein you do seek to know what is hidden.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:span text:style-name="T15">11. And the other angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden told me what is first and last in the heaven in the height, and beneath the earth in the depth, and at the ends of the heaven, and on the foundation of the heaven. 12. And the chambers of the winds, and how the winds are divided, and how they are weighed, and (how) the portals of the winds are reckoned, each according to the power of the wind, and the power of the lights of the moon, and according to the power that is fitting: and the divisions of the stars according to their names, and how all the divisions are divided. 13. And the thunder according to the places where they fall, and all the divisions that are made among the lightning that it may lighten, and their host that they may at once obey. 14. For the thunder has places of rest (which) are assigned (to it) while it is waiting for its peak; and the thunder and lightning are inseparable, and although not one and undivided, they both go together through the spirit and separate not. 15. For when the lightning lightens, the thunder utters its voice, and the spirit enforces a pause during the pearl, and divides equally between them; for the treasury of their peals is like the sand, and each one of them as it peels is held in with a bridle, and turned back by the power of the spirit, and pushed forward according to the many quarters of the earth. And the spirit of the sea is masculine and strong, and according to the might of his strength he draws it back with a rein, and in like manner it is driven forward and disperses amid all the mountains of the earth. 17. And the spirit of the hoar-frost is his own angel, and the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">spirit of the hail is a good angel. 18. And the spirit of the snow has forsaken his chambers on account of his strength--There is a special spirit therein, and that which ascends from it is like smoke, and its name is frost. 19. And the spirit of the mist is not united with them in their chambers, but it has a special chamber; for its course is glorious both in light and in darkness, and in winter and in summer, and in its chamber is an angel. 20. And the spirit of the dew has its dwelling at the ends of the heaven, and is connected with the chambers of the rain, and its course is in winter and summer: and its clouds and the clouds of the mist are connected, and the one gives to the other. 21. And when the spirit of the rain goes forth from its chamber, the angels come and open the chamber and lead it out, and when it is diffused over the whole earth it unites with the water on the earth. And whenever it unites with the water on the earth . . . 22. For the waters are for those who dwell on the earth; for they are nourishment for the earth from the Most High who is in heaven: therefore there is a measure for the rain, and the angels take it in charge. 23. And these things I saw towards the Garden of the Righteous. 24. And the angel of peace who was with me said to me: &apos;These two monsters, prepared conformably to the greatness of God, shall feed . . .</text:span></text:p>

For lead and tin are not produced from the earth like the first: it is a fountain that produces them, and an angel stands therein, and that angel is pre-eminent.&apos; 9. And after that my grandfatherEnoch took hold of me by my hand and raised me up, and said to me: &apos;Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits as touching this commotion on the earth. 10. And He said to me: &quot;Because of their unrighteousness their judgement has been determined upon and shall not be withheld by Me for ever. Because of the sorceries which they have searched out and learnt, the earth and those who dwell upon it shall be destroyed.&quot; 11. And these--they have no place of repentance for ever, because they have shown them what was hidden, and they are the damned: but as for thee, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that you are pure, and guiltless of this reproach concerning the secrets.</text:span></text:p>

And this is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of heaven, and its setting in the western portals of heaven. 3.

And first there goes forth the great luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like the circumference of heaven, and he is quite filled with illuminating and heating fire. 5. The chariot on which he ascends, the wind drives, and the sun goes down from heaven and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate (lit. &apos;that&apos;) portal and shines in the face of heaven. 6. In this way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which is the fourth ⌈those six portals in the cast⌉. 7. And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in the first month are twelve window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are opened in their season. 8. When the sun rises in heaven, he comes forth through that fourth portal thirty mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in the west of heaven. 9. And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter to the thirtieth morning. 10. On that day the day is longer than the night by a ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. 11. And the sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">fifth portal. 12.

And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign. 14. On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double the night, and the day becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts. 15. And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises from it and sets thirty mornings. 16. And when thirty mornings are accomplished, the day decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven. 17. And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for thirty mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western portal. 18. On that day the day decreases by two parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night to eight parts. 19. And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the west. 20. On that day the day is equalised with the night, [and becomes of equal length], and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to nine parts. 21. And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and returns to the east and rises thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the west in the third portal. 22. And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night becomes longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight parts. 23. And the sun rises from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and for thirty mornings rises in the second portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the second portal in the west of the heaven. 24. And on that day the night amounts to eleven parts and the day to seven parts. 25. And the sun rises on that day from that second portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of the heaven. 26. And on that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day: and the night amounts exactly to twelve parts and the day to six. 27. And the sun has (therewith) traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west opposite to it. 28. And on that night the night has decreased in length by a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">ninth part, and the night has become eleven parts and the day seven parts. 29. And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising and setting. 30. And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts and the day to eight. 31. And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the heaven. 32. On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night is equal to the day and the year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four. 33. And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise--through the course of the sun these distinctions are made (lit. &apos;they are separated&apos;). 34. So it comes that its course becomes daily longer, and its course nightly shorter. 35. And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. 36. And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to its appearance, according as the Lord commanded. 37. As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.</text:span></text:p>

And her rising and setting change every month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is uniform (i.e. full) it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the sun. 4.

And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, (and) the fourteenth part of her light. 6.

   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:span text:style-name="T15">1. And I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she performs her monthly revolution. 2. And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all, showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months as they were, and the appearance of their lights till fifteen days were accomplished. 3. In single seventh parts she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all her darkness in the west. 4. And in certain months she alters her settings, and in certain months she pursues her own peculiar course. 5. In two months the moon sets with the sun: in those two middle portals the third and the fourth. 6. She goes forth for seven days, and turns about and returns again through the portal where the sun rises, and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth. 7. And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and enters into the first portal in eight days. 8. And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the sun goes forth. 9. Thus I saw their position--how the moons rose and the sun set in those days. 10. And if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days which accrue to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days. 11. And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in 5 years 6 days every year come to 30 days: and the moon falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days. 12. And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days. 13. In 3 years there are 1092 days, and in 5 years 1820 days, so that in 8 years there </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">are 2912 days. 14. For the moon alone the days amount in 3 years to 1062 days, and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind: [i.e. to the sum (of 1770) there is to be added (1000 and) 62 days.] 15. And in 5 years there are 1770 days, so that for the moon the days in 8 years amount to 2832 days. 16. [For in 8 years she falls behind to the amount of 80 days], all the days she falls behind in 8 years are 80. 17. And the youar is accurately completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets 30 days.</text:span></text:p>

And owing to them men go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the world-stations, one in the first portal, one in the third portal of the heaven, one in the fourth portal, and one in the sixth portal, and the exactness of the year is accomplished through its separate three hundred and sixty-four stations. 3. For the signs and the times and the youars and the days the angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven, in the heaven and in the world, that they should rule on the face of the heaven and be seen on the earth, and be leaders for the day and the night, i.e. the sun, moon, and stars, and all the ministering creatures which make their revolution in all the chariots of the heaven. 4.

And the moon has four names: the first name is Asônjâ, the second Eblâ, the third Benâsê, and the fourth Erâe. 3. These are the two great luminaries: their circumference is like the circumference of heaven, and the size of the circumference of both is alike. 4. In the circumference of the sun there are seven portions of light which are added to it more than to the moon, and in definite measures it is transferred till the seventh portion of the sun is exhausted. 5. And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their revolution by the north, and come forth through the eastern portals on the face of heaven. 6. And when the moon rises one-fourteenth part appears in the heaven: ⌈the light becomes full in her⌉: on the fourteenth day she accomplishes her light. 7. And fifteen parts of light are transferred to her till the fifteenth day (when) her light is accomplished, according to the sign of the year, and she becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by (the addition of) fourteenth parts. 8. And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of her light, on the second to thirteen parts of light, on the third to twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on the fifth to ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to eight, on the eighth to seven, on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to four, on the twelfth to three, on the thirteenth to two, on the fourteenth to the half of a seventh, and all her remaining light disappears wholly on the fifteenth. 9. And in certain months the month has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight. 10. And Uriel showed me another law: when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is transferred to her by the sun. 11. During all the period during which the moon is growing in her light, she is transferring it to herself when opposite to the sun during fourteen days [her light is accomplished in the heaven], and when she is illumined throughout, her light is accomplished fully in the heaven. 12. And on the first day she is called the new moon, for on that day the light rises upon her. 13. She becomes full moon exactly on the day when the sun sets in the west, and from the east she rises at night, and the moon shines the whole night through till the sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over against the sun. 14. On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes till all the light vanishes </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and all the days of the month are at an end, and her circumference is empty, void of light. 15. And three months she makes thirty days, and at her time she makes three months of twenty-nine days each, in which she accomplishes her waning in the first period of time, and in the first portal for one hundred and seventy-seven days. 16. And in the time of her going out she appears for three months (of) thirty days each, and for three months she appears (of) twenty-nine each. 17.

Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one was quite unlike the other: the first when I was learning to write: the second before I took thy mother, (when) I saw a terrible vision. And regarding them I prayed to the Lord. 3. I had laid me down in the house of my grandfather Mahalalel, (when) I saw in a vision how the heaven collapsed and was borne off and fell to the earth. 4. And when it fell to the earth I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent from their stems, and hurled down and sunk in the abyss. 5. And thereupon a word fell into my mouth, and I lifted up (my voice) to cry aloud, and said: &apos;The earth is destroyed.&apos; 6. And my grandfather Mahalalel woke me as I lay near him, and said to me: &apos;Why do you cry so, my son, and why do you make such a lament?&apos; 7. And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen, and he said to me: &apos;A terrible thing hast you seen, my son, and of grave moment is thy dream-vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the earth: it must sink into the abyss and be destroyed with a great destruction. 8. And now, my son, arise and make a petition to the Lord of glory, since you are a believer, that a remnant may remain on the earth, and that He may not destroy the whole earth. 9. My son, from heaven all this will come upon the earth, and upon the earth there will be great destruction. 10. After that I arose and prayoud and implored and besought, and wrote down my prayer for the generations of the world, and I will show everything to thee, my son Methuselah. 11. And when I had gone forth below and seen the heaven, and the sun rising in the east, and the moon setting in the west, and a few stars, and the whole earth, and everything as He had known it in the beginning, then I blessed the Lord of judgement and praised Him because He had made the sun to go forth from the windows of the east, and he ascended and rose on the face of the heaven, and set out and kept traversing the path shown unto him.</text:p>

And again I saw those sheep that they again erred and went many ways, and forsook that their house, and the Lord of the sheep called some from amongst the sheep and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to slay them. 52. And one of them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and cried aloud over the sheep; and they sought to slay it, but the Lord of the sheep saved it from the sheep, and brought it up to me, and caused it to dwell there. 53. And many other sheep He sent to those sheep to testify unto them and lament over them. 54. And after that I saw that when they forsook the house of the Lord and His tower they fell away entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place. 55. And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep. 56. And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and devour them, into the hand of all the wild beasts. 57. And I began to cry aloud with all my power, and to appeal to the Lord of the sheep, and to represent to Him in regard to the sheep that they were devoured by all the wild beasts. 58. But He remained unmoved, yough He saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and swallowed and robbed, and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts. 59. And He called seventy shepherds, and cast those sheep to them that they might pasture them, and He spoke to the shepherds and their companions: &quot;Let each individual of you pasture the sheep henceforward, and everything that I shall command you that do you. 60. And I will deliver them over unto you duly numbered, and tell you which of them are to be destroyed--and then destroy you.&quot; And He gave over unto them those sheep. 61. And He called another and spoke unto him: &quot;Observe and mark everything that the shepherds will do to those sheep; for they will destroy more of them than I have commanded them. 62. And every excess and the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds, record (namely) how many they destroy according to my command, and how many according to their own caprice: record against every individual shepherd all the destruction he effects. 63. And read out before me by number how many they destroy, and how many they </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">deliver over for destruction, that I may have this as a testimony against them, and know every deed of the shepherds, that I may comprehend and see what they do, whether or not they abide by my command which I have commanded them. 64. But they shall not know it, and you shall not declare it to them, nor admonish them, but only record against each individual all the destruction which the shepherds affect each in his time and lay it all before me.&quot; 65. And I saw till those shepherds pastured in their season, and they began to slay and to destroy more than they were bidden, and they delivered those sheep into the hand of the lions. 66. And the lions and tigers eat and devour the greater part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished that house. 67. And I became exceedingly sorrowful over that tower because that house of the sheep was demolished, and afterwards I was unable to see if those sheep entered that house.</text:span></text:p>

And each one slew and destroyed many more than was prescribed; and I began to weep and lament on account of those sheep. 70. And thus in the vision I saw that one who wrote, how he wrote down every one that was destroyed by those shepherds, day by day, and carried up and laid down and showed actually the whole book to the Lord of the sheep--(even) everything that they had done, and all that each one of them had made away with, and all that they had given over to destruction. 71.

And they began again to build as before, and they reared up that tower, and it was named the high tower; and they began again to place a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure. 74. And as touching all this the eyes of those sheep were blinded so that they saw not, and (the eyes of) their shepherds likewise; and they delivered them in large numbers to their shepherds for destruction, and they trampled the sheep with their feet and devoured them. 75. And the Lord of the sheep remained unmoved till all the sheep were dispersed over the field and mingled with them (i.e. the beasts), and they (i.e. the shepherds) did not save them out of the hand of the beasts. 76. And this one who wrote the book carried it up, and showed it and read it before the Lord of the sheep, and implored Him on their account, and besought Him on their account as he showed Him all the doings of the shepherds, and gave testimony before Him against all the shepherds.

And now I know this mystery, that sinners will alter and pervert the words of righteousness in many ways, and will speak wicked words, and lie, and practise great deceits, and write books concerning their words. 11. But when they write down truthfully all my words in their languages, and do not change or diminish from my words but write them all down truthfully--all that I first testified concerning them. 12. Then, I know another mystery, that books will be given to the righteous and the wise to become a cause of joy and uprightness and much wisdom. 13. And to them shall the books be given, and they shall believe in them and rejoice over them, and then shall all the righteous who have learnt therefrom all the paths of uprightness be recompensed.&apos;</text:span></text:p>

And his body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes beautiful. And when he opened his eyes, he lit up the whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. 3. And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of righteousness. 4. And his father Lamech was afraid of him and fled, and came to his father Methuselah. 5. And he said to him: &apos;I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike man, and resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his countenance is glorious. 6. And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels, and I fear that in his days a wonder may be wrought on the earth. 7. And now, my father, I am here to petition thee and implore thee that you mayoust go to Enoch, our father, and learn from him the truth, for his dwelling-place is amongst the angels.&apos; 8. And when Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; for he had heard that I was there, and he cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to him. And 1 said to him: &apos;Behold, here am I, my son, wherefore have you come to me?&apos; 9. And he answered and said: &apos;Because of a great cause of anxiety have I come to thee, and because of a disturbing vision have I approached. 10. And now, my father, hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like man&apos;s nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and thereupon lighted up the whole house. 11. And he arose in the hands of the midwife, and opened his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven. 12. And his father Lamech became afraid and fled to me, and did not believe that he was sprung from him, but that he was in the likeness of the angels of heaven; and behold I have come to thee that you mayoust make known to me the truth.&apos; 13. And I, Enoch, answered and said to him: &apos;The Lord will do a new thing on the earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and make known to thee that in the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven transgressed the word of the Lord. 14. And behold they commit sin and transgress the law, and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have begot children by them. 17. And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed from all impurity. 15. youa, there shall come a great destruction over the whole earth, and there shall be a deluge and a great destruction for one youar. 16. And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the earth, and his three children shall be saved with him: when all mankind that are on the earth shall die [he and his sons shall be saved]. 18. And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah; for he shall be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved from the destruction, which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and all the unrighteousness, which shall be consummated on the earth in his days. 19. And after that there shall be still more unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the earth; for I know the mysteries of the holy ones; for He, the Lord, has shown me and informed me, and I have read (them) in the heavenly tablets.</text:span></text:p>

And wait you indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed forever, and their spirits shall be slain, and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place that is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for there is no earth there. 4. And I saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason of its depth I could not look over, and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things like shining mountains circling and sweeping to and fro. 5. And I asked one of the holy angels who was with me and said to him: &apos;What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven but only the flame of a blazing fire, and the voice of weeping and crying and lamentation and strong pain.&apos; 6. And he said to me: &apos;This place which you seest--here are cast the spirits of sinners and blasphemers, and of those who work wickedness, and of those who pervert everything that the Lord hath spoken through the mouth of the prophets--(even) the things that shall be. 7. For some of them are written and inscribed above in the heaven, in order that the angels may read them and know that which shall befall the sinners, and the spirits of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed by God; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men: 8. Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the world, but gave over their bodies to torture. 9. Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food, but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits were found pure so that they should bless His name. 10. And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books. And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yout they blessed Me. 11.

And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour. 13. And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. 14. And they shall see those who were born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. 15. And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.&apos;</text:span></text:p>

He put out his hand, took her and brought her in to him in the ark. 10 He waited another seven days and again sent the dove out from the ark. 11 The dove came in to him in the evening, and there in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf, so Noach knew that the water had cleared from the earth. 12 He waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, and she didn’t return to him any more.</text:p>

Walk in my presence and be pure-hearted. 2 I will make my covenant between me and you, and I will increase your numbers greatly.” 3 Avram fell on his face, and God continued speaking with him: 4 “As for me, this is my covenant with you: you will be the father of many nations. 5 Your name will no longer be Avram [exalted father], but your name will be Avraham [father of many], because I have made you the father of many nations. 6 I will cause you to be very fruitful. I will make nations of you, kings will descend from you.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">9 God said to Avraham, “As for you, you are to keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you, generation after generation. 10 Here is my covenant, which you are to keep, between me and you, along with your descendants after you: every male among you is to be circumcised. 11 You are to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; this will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 12 Generation after generation, every male among you who is eight days old is to be circumcised, including slaves born within your household and those bought from a foreigner not descended from you. 13 The slave born in your house and the person bought with your money must be circumcised; thus my covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant. 14 Any uncircumcised male who will not let himself be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin — that person will be cut off from his people, because he has broken my covenant.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">15 God said to Avraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are not to call her Sarai [mockery]; her name is to be Sarah [princess]. 16 I will bless her; moreover, I will give you a son by her. Truly I will bless her: she will be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.” 17 At this Avraham fell on his face and laughed — he </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">thought to himself, “Will a child be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah give birth at ninety?” 18 Avraham said to God, “If only Yishma‘el could live in your presence!” 19 God answered, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you are to call him Yitz’chak [laughter]. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 20 But as for Yishma‘el, I have heard you. I have blessed him. I will make him fruitful and give him many descendants. He will father twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 21 But I will establish my covenant with Yitz’chak, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.” 22 With that, God finished speaking with Avraham and went up from him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">23 Avraham took Yishma‘el his son, all the slaves born in his house and all who had been bought with his money, every male among the people in Avraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very day, just as God had said to him.</text:p>

On seeing them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, prostrated himself on the ground, 3 and said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, please don’t leave your servant. 4 Please let me send for some water, so that you can wash your feet; then rest under the tree, 5 and I will bring a piece of bread.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">6 Avraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, three measures of the best flour!

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The two angels came to S’dom that evening, when Lot was sitting at the gate of S’dom. Lot saw them, got up to greet them and prostrated himself on the ground. 2 He said, “Here now, my lords, please come over to your servant’s house. Spend the night, wash your feet, get up early, and go on your way.” “No,” they answered, “we’ll stay in the square.” 3 But he kept pressing them; so they went home with him; and he made them a meal, baking </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">matzah</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> for their supper, which they ate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 But before they could go to bed, the men of the city surrounded the house — young and old, everyone from every neighborhood of S’dom. 5 They called Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to stay with you tonight? Bring them out to us! We want to have sex with them!” 6 Lot went out to them and stood in the doorway, closing the door behind him, 7 and said, “Please, my brothers, don’t do such a wicked thing. 8 Look here, I have two daughters who are virgins. Please, let me bring them out to you, and you can do with them what seems good to you; but don’t do anything to these men, since they are guests in my house.” 9 “Stand back!” they replied. “This guy came to live here, and now he’s decided to play judge. For that we’ll deal worse with you than with them!” Then they crowded in on Lot, in order to get close enough to break down the door. 10 But the men inside reached out their hands, brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door. 11 Then they struck the men at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they couldn’t find the doorway.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">12 The men said to Lot, “Do you have any people here besides yourself? Whomever you have in the city — son-in-law, your sons, your daughters — bring them out of this place; 13 because we are going to destroy it. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has become aware of the great outcry against them, and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has sent us to destroy it.” 14 Lot went out and spoke with his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, “Get up and leave this place, because </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> is going to destroy the city.” But his sons-in-law didn’t take him seriously.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">15 When morning came, the angels told Lot to hurry. “Get up,” they said, “and take your wife and your two daughters who are here; otherwise you will be swept away in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the punishment of the city.” 16 But he dallied, so the men took hold of his hand, his wife’s hand and the hands of his two daughters — </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> was being merciful to him — and led them, leaving them outside the city. 17 When they had brought them out, he said, “Flee for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain, but escape to the hills! Otherwise you will be swept away.” 18 Lot said to them, “Please, no, my lord! 19 Here, your servant has already found favor in your sight, and you have shown me even greater mercy by saving my life. But I can’t escape to the hills, because I’m afraid the disaster will overtake me, and I will die. 20 Look, there’s a town nearby to flee to, and it’s a small one. Please let me escape there — isn’t it just a small one? — and that way I will stay alive.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> 21 He replied, “All right, I agree to what you have asked. I won’t overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 22 Hurry, and escape to that place, because I can’t do anything until you arrive there.” For this reason the city was named Tzo‘ar [small].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">23 By the time Lot had come to Tzo‘ar, the sun had risen over the land. 24 Then </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> caused sulfur and fire to rain down upon S’dom and ‘Amora from </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> out of the sky. 25 He overthrew those cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities and everything growing in the ground. 26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a column of salt.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">27 Avraham got up early in the morning, went to the place where he had stood before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, 28 and looked out toward S’dom and ‘Amora, scanning the entire plain. There before him the smoke was rising from the land like smoke from a furnace! 29 But when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Avraham and sent Lot out, away from the destruction, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">30 Lot went up from Tzo‘ar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, because he was afraid to stay in Tzo‘ar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 31 The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there isn’t a man on earth to come in to us in the manner customary in the world. 32 Come, let’s have our father drink wine; then we’ll sleep with him, and that way we’ll enable our father to have descendants.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>33 So they plied their father with wine that night, and the older one went in and slept with her father; he didn’t know when she lay down or when she got up. 34 The following day, the older said to the younger, “Here, I slept last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him, and that way we’ll enable our father to have descendants.” 35 They plied their father with wine that night also, and the younger one got up and slept with him, and he didn’t know when she lay down or when she got up. 36 Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">37 The older one gave birth to a son and called him Mo’av; he is the ancestor of Mo’av to this day. 38 The younger also gave birth to a son, and she called him Ben-‘Ammi; he is the ancestor of the people of ‘Amon to this day.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Avraham traveled from there toward the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. While living as an alien in G’rar, 2 Avraham was saying of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister”; so Avimelekh king of G’rar sent and took Sarah. 3 But God came to Avimelekh in a dream one night and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, since she is someone’s wife.” 4 Now Avimelekh had not come near her; so he said, “Lord, will you kill even an upright nation? 5 Didn’t he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And even she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In doing this, my heart has been pure and my hands innocent.” 6 God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in doing this, your heart has been pure; and I too have kept you from sinning against me. This is why I didn’t let you touch her. 7 Therefore, return the man’s wife to him now. He is a prophet, and he will pray for you, so that you will live. But if you don’t return her, know that you will certainly die — you and all who belong to you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">8 Avimelekh got up early in the morning, called all his servants and told them these things; and the men became very afraid. 9 Then Avimelekh called Avraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you to cause you to bring on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done things to me that are just not done.” 10 Avimelekh went on, asking Avraham, “Whatever could have caused you to do such a thing?” 11 Avraham replied, “It was because I thought, ‘There could not possibly be any fear of God in this place, so they will kill me in order to get my wife.’ 12 But she actually is also my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and so she became my wife. 13 When God had me leave my father’s house, I told her, ‘Do me this favor: wherever we go, say about me, “He is my brother.”’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">14 Avimelekh took sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves, and gave them to Avraham; and he returned to him Sarah his wife. 15 Then Avimelekh said, “Look, my country lies before you; live where you like.” 16 To Sarah he said, “Here, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. That will allay the suspicions of everyone who is with you. Before everyone you are cleared.” 17 Avraham prayed to God, and God healed Avimelekh and his wife and slave-girls, so that they could have children. 18 For <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span> had made every woman in Avimelekh’s household infertile on account of Sarah Avraham’s wife.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> remembered Sarah as he had said, and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> did for Sarah what he had promised. 2 Sarah conceived and bore Avraham a son in his old age, at the very time God had said to him. 3 Avraham called his son, born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Yitz’chak. 4 Avraham circumcised his son Yitz’chak when he was eight days old, as God had ordered him to do.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> 5 Avraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitz’chak [laughter] was born to him. 6 Sarah said, “God has given me good reason to laugh; now everyone who hears about it will laugh with me.” 7 And she said, “Who would have said to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children? Nevertheless, I have borne him a son in his old age!”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">8 The child grew and was weaned, and Avraham gave a great banquet on the day that Yitz’chak was weaned. 9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom Hagar had borne to Avraham, making fun of Yitz’chak; 10 so Sarah said to Avraham, “Throw this slave-girl out! And her son! I will not have this slave-girl’s son as your heir along with my son Yitz’chak!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Avraham became very distressed over this matter of his son. 12 But God said to Avraham, “Don’t be distressed because of the boy and your slave-girl. Listen to everything Sarah says to you, because it is your descendants through Yitz’chak who will be counted. 13 But I will also make a nation from the son of the slave-girl, since he is descended from you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">14 Avraham got up early in the morning, took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child; then he sent her away. After leaving, she wandered in the desert around Be’er-Sheva. 15 When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under a bush, 16 and went and sat down, looking the other way, about a bow-shot’s distance from him; because she said, “I can’t bear to watch my child die.” So she sat there, looking the other way, crying out and weeping. 17 God heard the boy’s voice, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What’s wrong with you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, because God has heard </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the voice of the boy in his present situation. 18 Get up, lift the boy up, and hold him tightly in your hand, because I am going to make him a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went, filled the skin with water and gave the boy water to drink.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">20 God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the desert and became an archer. 21 He lived in the Pa’ran Desert, and his mother chose a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</text:p>

They said, “God is with you in everything you do. 23 Therefore, swear to me here by God that you will never deal falsely with me or with my son or grandson; but according to the kindness with which I have treated you, you will treat me and the land in which you have lived as a foreigner. 24 Avraham said, “I swear it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">25 Now Avraham had complained to Avimelekh about a well which Avimelekh’s servants had seized. 26 Avimelekh answered, “I don’t know who has done this. You didn’t tell me, and I heard about it only today.” 27 Avraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Avimelekh, and the two of them made a covenant. 28 Avraham put seven female lambs from the flock by themselves. 29 Avimelekh asked Avraham, “What is the meaning of these seven female lambs you have put by themselves?” 30 He answered, “You are to accept these seven female lambs from me as witness that I dug this well.” 31 This is why that place was called Be’er-Sheva [well of seven, well of an oath] — because they both swore an oath there. 32 When they made the covenant at Be’er-Sheva, Avimelekh departed with Pikhol the commander of his army and returned to the land of the P’lishtim. 33 Avraham planted a tamarisk tree in Be’er-Sheva, and there he called on the name of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, the everlasting God. 34 Avraham lived for a long time as a foreigner in the land of the P’lishtim.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After these things, God tested Avraham. He said to him, “Avraham!” and he answered, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Yitz’chak; and go to the land of Moriyah. There you are to offer him as a burnt offering on a mountain that I will point out to you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">3 Avraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, together with Yitz’chak his son. He cut the wood for the burnt offering, departed and went toward the place God had told him about. 4 On the third day, Avraham raised his eyes and saw the place in the distance. 5 Avraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey.

   <text:h text:style-name="P73" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_xvnah1yt5xiq"/>Haggada - Job And The Patriarchs</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Job, the most pious Gentile that ever lived, one of the few to bear the title of honor &quot;the servant of God,&quot; was of double kin to Jacob. He was a grandson of Jacob&apos;s brother Esau, and at the same time the son-in-law of Jacob himself, for he had married Dinah as his second wife. He was entirely worthy of being a member of the Patriarch&apos;s family, for he was perfectly upright, one that feared God, and eschewed evil. Had he not wavered in his resignation to the Divine will during the great trial to which he was subjected, and murmured against God, the distinction would have been conferred upon him of having his name joined to the Name of God in prayer, and men would have called upon the God of Job as they now call upon the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But he was not found steadfast like the three Fathers, and he forfeited the honor God had intended for him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">The Lord remonstrated with him for his lack of patience, saying: &quot;Why didst thou murmur when suffering came upon thee? Dost thou think thyself of greater worth than Adam, the creation of Mine own hands, upon whom together with his descendants I decreed death on account of a single transgression? And yet Adam murmured not. Thou art surely not more worthy than Abraham, whom I tempted with many trials, and when he asked, &apos;Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the land?&apos; and I replied, &apos;Know of a surety that thy seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years,&apos; he yet murmured not. Thou dost not esteem thyself more worthy than Moses, dost thou? Him I would not grant the favor of entering the promised land, because he spake the words, &apos;Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?&apos; And yet he murmured not. Art thou more worthy than Aaron, unto whom I showed greater honor than unto any created being, for I sent the angels themselves out of the Holy of Holies when he entered the place? Yet when his two sons died, he murmured not.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31"><text:soft-page-break/>The contrast between Job and the Patriarchs appears from words spoken by him and words spoken by Abraham. Addressing God, Abraham said, &quot;That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked,&quot; and Job exclaimed against God, &quot;It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.&quot; They both received their due recompense, Abraham was rewarded and Job was punished.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Convinced that his suffering was undeserved and unjust, Job had the audacity to say to God: &quot;O Lord of the world, Thou didst create the ox with cloven feet and the ass with unparted hoof, Thou hast created Paradise and hell, Thou createst the righteous and also the wicked. There is none to hinder, Thou canst do as seemeth good in Thy sight.&quot; The friends of Job replied: &quot;It is true, God hath created the evil inclination, but He hath also given man the Torah as a remedy against it. Therefore the wicked cannot roll their guilt from off their shoulders and put it upon God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The reason Job did not shrink from such extravagant utterances was because he denied the resurrection of the dead. He judged of the prosperity of the wicked and the woes of the pious only by their earthly fortunes. Proceeding from this false premise, he held it to be possible that the punishment falling to his share was not at all intended for him. God had slipped into an error, He imposed the suffering upon him that had been appointed unto a sinner. But God spake to him, saying: &quot;Many hairs have I created upon the head of man, yet each hair hath its own sac, for were two hairs to draw their nourishment from the same sac, man would lose the sight of his eyes. It hath never happened that a sac hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? I let many drops of rain descend from the heavens, and for each drop there is a mould in the clouds, for were two drops to issue from the same mould, the ground would be made so miry that it could not bring forth any growth. It hath never happened that a mould hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? Many thunderbolts I hurl from the skies, but each one comes from its own path, for were two to proceed from the same path, they would destroy the whole world. It hath never happened that a path hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? The gazelle gives birth to her young on the topmost point of a rock, and it would fall into the abyss and be crushed to death, if I did not send an eagle thither to catch it up and carry it to its </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">mother. Were the eagle to appear a minute earlier or later than the appointed time, the little gazelle would perish. It hath never happened that the proper minute of time was missed. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? The hind has a contracted womb, and would not be able to bring forth her young, if I did not send a dragon to her at the right second, to nibble at her womb and soften it, for then she can bear. Were the dragon to come a second before or after the right time, the hind would perish. It hath never happened that I missed the right second. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another?&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Notwithstanding Job&apos;s unpardonable words, God was displeased with his friends for passing harsh judgment upon him. &quot;A man may not be held responsible for what he does in his anguish,&quot; and Job&apos;s agony was great, indeed.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P73" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_f3ns0u69al56"/>Haggada - Job&apos;s Wealth And Benefactions</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Job was asked once what he considered the severest affliction that could strike him, and he replied, &quot;My enemies&apos; joy in my misfortune, and when God demanded to know of him, after the accusations made by Satan, what he preferred, poverty or physical suffering, he chose pain, saying, &quot;O Lord of the whole world, chastise my body with suffering of all kinds, only preserve me from poverty.&quot; Poverty seemed the greater scourge, because before his trials he had occupied a brilliant position on account of his vast wealth. God graciously granted him this foretaste of the Messianic time. The harvest followed close upon the ploughing of his field; no sooner were the seeds strewn in the furrows, than they sprouted and grew and ripened produce. He was equally successful with his cattle. His sheep killed wolves, but were themselves never harmed by wild beasts. Of sheep he had no less than one hundred and thirty thousand, and he required eight hundred dogs to keep guard over them, not to mention the two hundred dogs needed to secure the safety of his house. Besides, his herds consisted of three hundred and forty thousand asses and thirty-five hundred pairs of oxen. All these possessions were not used for self-indulgent pleasures, but for the good of the poor and the needy, whom he clothed, and fed, and provided with all things necessary. To do all this, he even had to employ ships that carried supplies to all the cities and the dwelling-places of the destitute. His house was furnished with doors on all its four sides, that the poor and the wayfarer might enter, no matter </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">from what direction they approached. At all times there were thirty tables laden with viands ready in his house, and twelve besides for widows only, so that all who came found what they desired. Job&apos;s consideration for the poor was so delicate that he kept servants to wait upon them constantly. His guests, enraptured by his charitableness, frequently offered themselves as attendants to minister to the poor in his house, but Job always insisted upon paying them for their services. If he was asked for a loan of money, to be used for business purposes, and the borrower promised to give a part of his profits to the poor, he would demand no security beyond a mere signature. And if it happened that by some mischance or other the debtor was not able to discharge his obligation, Job would return the note to him, or tear it into bits in his presence.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">He did not rest satisfied at supplying the material needs of those who applied to him. He strove also to convey the knowledge of God to them. After a meal he was in the habit of having music played upon instruments, and then he would invite those present to join him in songs of praise to God. On such occasions he did not consider himself above playing the cithern while the musicians rested.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Most particularly Job concerned himself about the weal and woe of widows and orphans. He was wont to pay visits to the sick, both rich and poor, and when it was necessary, he would bring a physician along with him. If the case turned out to be hopeless, he would sustain the stricken family with advice and consolation. When the wife of the incurably sick man began to grieve and weep, he would encourage her with such words as these: &quot;Trust always in the grace and lovingkindness of God. He hath not abandoned thee until now, and He will not forsake thee henceforth. Thy husband will be restored to health, and will be able to provide for his family as heretofore. But if--which may God forefend--thy husband should die, I call Heaven to witness that I shall provide sustenance for thee and thy children.&quot; Having spoken thus, he would send for a notary, and have him draw up a document, which he signed in the presence of witnesses, binding himself to care for the family, should it be bereaved of its head. Thus he earned for himself the blessing of the sick man and the gratitude of the sorrowing wife.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Sometimes, in case of necessity, Job could be severe, too, especially when it was a question of helping a poor man obtain his due. If one of the parties to a suit cited </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">before his tribunal was known to be a man of violence, he would surround himself with his army and inspire him with fear, so that the culprit could not but show himself amenable to his decision.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">He endeavored to inculcate his benevolent ways upon his children, by accustoming them to wait upon the poor. On the morrow after a feast he would sacrifice bountifully to God, and together with the pieces upon the altar his offerings would be divided among the needy. He would say: &quot;Take and help yourselves, and pray for my children. It may be that they have sinned, and renounced God, saying in the presumption of their hearts: &apos;We are the children of this rich man. All these things are our possessions. Why should we be servants to the poor?&apos;&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P73" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_55j1i2imtlud"/>Haggada - Satan And Job</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">The happy, God-pleasing life led by Job for many years excited the hatred of Satan, who had an old grudge against him. Near Job&apos;s house there was an idol worshipped by the people. Suddenly doubts assailed the heart of Job, and he asked himself: &quot;Is this idol really the creator of heaven and earth? How can I find out the truth about it?&quot; In the following night he perceived a voice calling: &quot;Jobab! Jobab! Arise, and I will tell thee who he is whom thou desirest to know. This one to whom the people offer sacrifices is not God, he is the handiwork of the tempter, wherewith he deceives men.&quot; When he heard the voice, Job threw himself on the ground, and said: &quot;O Lord, if this idol is the handiwork of the tempter, then grant that I may destroy it. None can hinder me, for I am the king of this land.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Job, or, as he is sometimes called, Jobab, was, indeed, king of Edom, the land wherein wicked plans are concocted against God, wherefore it is called also Uz, &quot;counsel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The voice continued to speak. It made itself known as that of an archangel of God, and revealed to Job that he would bring down the enmity of Satan upon himself by the destruction of the idol, and much suffering with it. However, if he remained steadfast under them, God would change his troubles into joys, his name would become celebrated throughout the generations of mankind, and he would have a share in the resurrection to eternal life. Job replied to the voice: &quot;Out of love of God I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">am ready to endure all things unto the day of my death. I will shrink back from naught.&quot; Now Job arose, and accompanied by fifty men he repaired to the idol, and destroyed it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Knowing that Satan would try to approach him, he ordered his guard not to give access to any one, and then he withdrew to his chamber. He had guessed aright. Satan appeared at once, in the guise of a beggar, and demanded speech with Job. The guard executed his orders, and forbade his entering. Then the mendicant asked him to intercede for him with Job for a piece of bread. Job knew it was Satan, and he sent word to him as follows, &quot;Do not expect to eat of my bread, for it is prohibited unto thee,&quot; at the same time putting a piece of burnt bread into the hand of the guard for Satan. The servant was ashamed to give a beggar burnt bread, and he substituted a good piece for it. Satan, however, knowing that the servant had not executed his master&apos;s errand, told him so to his face, and he fetched the burnt bread and handed it to him, repeating the words of Job. Thereupon Satan returned this answer, &quot;As the bread is burnt, so I will disfigure thy body.&quot; Job replied: &quot;Do as thou desirest, and execute thy plan. As for me, I am ready to suffer whatever thou bringest down upon me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Now Satan betook himself to God, and prayed Him to put Job into his power, saying: &quot;I went to and fro in the earth, and walked up and down in it, and I saw no man as pious as Abraham. Thou didst promise him the whole land of Palestine, and yet he did not take it in ill part that he had not so much as a burial-place for Sarah. As for Job, it is true, I found none that loveth Thee as he does, but if Thou wilt put him into my hand, I shall succeed in turning his heart away from Thee.&quot; But God spake, &quot;Satan, Satan, what hast thou a mind to do with my servant Job, like whom there is none in the earth?&quot; Satan persisted in his request touching Job, and God granted it, He gave him full power over Job&apos;s possessions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">This day of Job&apos;s accusation was the New Year&apos;s Day, whereon the good and the evil deeds of man are brought before God.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">There was a man in the land of ‘Utz whose name was Iyov. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 2 Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 3 He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 pairs of oxen and 500 female donkeys, as well as a great number of servants; so that he was the wealthiest man in the east.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">4 It was the custom of his sons to give banquets, each on his set day in his own house; and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 After a cycle of banquets, Iyov would send for them to come and be consecrated; then he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings for each of them, because Iyov said, “My sons might have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts.” This is what Iyov did every time.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">13 One day when Iyov’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking in their oldest brother’s house, 14 a messenger came to him and said, “The oxen were plowing, with the donkeys grazing near them, 15 when a raiding party from Sh’va came and carried them off; they put the servants to the sword too, and I’m the only one who escaped to tell you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said, “Fire from God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants; it completely destroyed them, and I’m the only one who escaped to tell you.”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Equipped with unlimited power, Satan endeavored to deprive Job of all he owned. He burnt part of his cattle, and the other part was carried off by enemies. What pained Job more than this was that recipients of his bounty turned against him, and took of his belongings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Among the adversaries that assailed him was Lilith, the queen of Sheba. She lived at a great distance from his residence, it took her and her army three years to travel from her home to his. She fell upon his oxen and his asses, and took possession of them, after slaying the men to whose care Job had entrusted them. One man </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">escaped alone. Wounded and bruised, he had only enough life in him to tell Job the tale of his losses, and then he fell down dead. The sheep, which had been left unmolested by the queen of Sheba, were taken away by the Chaldeans. Job&apos;s first intention was to go to war against these marauders, but when he was told that some of his property had been consumed by fire from heaven, he desisted, and said, &quot;If the heavens turn against me, I can do nothing.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Dissatisfied with the result, Satan disguised himself as the king of Persia, besieged the city of Job&apos;s residence, took it, and spoke to the inhabitants, saying: &quot;This man Job hath appropriated all the goods in the world, leaving naught for others, and he hath also torn down the temple of our god, and now I will pay him back for his wicked deeds. Come with me and let us pillage his house.&quot; At first the people refused to hearken to the words of Satan. They feared that the sons and daughters of Job might rise up against them later, and avenge their father&apos;s wrongs. But after Satan had pulled down the house wherein the children of Job were assembled, and they lay dead in the ruins, the people did as he bade them, and sacked the house of Job.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing that neither the loss of all he had nor the death of his children could change his pious heart, Satan appeared before God a second time, and requested that Job himself, his very person, be put into his hand. God granted Satan&apos;s plea, but he limited his power to Job&apos;s body, his soul he could not touch. In a sense Satan was worse off than Job. He was in the position of the slave that has been ordered by his master to break the pitcher and not spill the wine.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Satan now caused a terrific storm to burst over the house of Job. He was cast from his throne by the reverberations, and he lay upon the floor for three hours. Then Satan smote his body with leprosy from the sole of his foot unto his crown. This plague forced Job to leave the city, and sit down outside upon an ash-heap, for his lower limbs were covered with oozing boils, and the issue flowed out upon the ashes. The upper part of his body was encrusted with dry boils, and to ease the itching they caused him, he used his nails, until they dropped off together with his fingertips, and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal. His body swarmed with vermin, but if one of the little creatures attempted to crawl away from him, he forced it back, saying, &quot;Remain on the place whither thou wast sent, until God </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">assigns another unto thee.&quot; His wife, fearful that he would not bear his horrible suffering with steadfastness, advised him to pray to God for death, that he might be sure of going hence an upright man. But he rejected her counsel, saying, &quot;If in the days of good fortune, which usually tempts men to deny God, I stood firm, and did not rebel against Him, surely I shall be able to remain steadfast under misfortune, which compels men to be obedient to God.&quot; And Job stuck to his resolve in spite of all suffering, while his wife was not strong enough to bear her fate with resignation to the will of God.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Her lot was bitter, indeed, for she had had to take service as a water-carrier with a common churl, and when her master learnt that she shared her bread with Job, he dismissed her. To keep her husband from starving, she cut off her hair, and purchased bread with it. It was all she had to pay the price charged by the bread merchant, none other than Satan himself, who wanted to put her to the test. He said to her, &quot;Hadst thou not deserved this great misery of thine, it had not come upon thee.&quot; This speech was more than the poor woman could bear. Then it was that she came to her husband, and amid tears and groans urged him to renounce God and die. Job, however, was not perturbed by her words, because he divined at once that Satan stood behind his wife, and seduced her to speak thus. Turning to the tempter, he said: &quot;Why dost thou not meet me frankly? Give up thy underhand ways, thou wretch.&quot; Thereupon Satan appeared before Job, admitted that he had been vanquished, and went away abashed.</text:p>

A person will give up everything he has to save his life. 5 But if you reach out your hand and touch his flesh and bone, without doubt he’ll curse you to your face!” 6 </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to the Adversary, “Here! He is in your hands, except that you are to spare his life.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">7 Then the Adversary went out from the presence of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and struck Iyov down with horrible infected sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 8 He took a piece of a broken pot to scratch himself and sat down in the pile of ashes. 9 His wife asked him, “Why do you still hold on to your integrity? Curse God, and die!” 10 But he answered her, “You’re talking like a low-class woman! Are we to receive the good at God’s hands but reject the bad?” In all this Iyov did not say one sinful word.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">11 Now when Iyov’s three friends heard of all the calamities that had overwhelmed him, they all came. Each came from his own home — Elifaz from Teiman, Bildad from Shuach and Tzofar from Na‘amah. They had agreed to meet together in order to come and offer him sympathy and comfort. 12 When they saw him from a distance, they couldn’t even recognize him. They wept aloud, tore their coats and threw dust over their heads toward heaven. 13 Then they sat down with him on the ground. For seven days and seven nights, no one spoke a word to him; because they saw how much he was suffering. 14 (3:1) At length, Iyov broke the silence and cursed the day of his [birth].</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_fs5hf2sh1rvy"/><text:soft-page-break/>Haggada - The Four Friends</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The friends of Job lived in different places, at intervals of three hundred miles one from the other. Nevertheless they all were informed of their friend&apos;s misfortune at the same time, in this way: Each one had the pictures of the others set in his crown, and as soon as any one of them met with reverses, it showed itself in his picture. Thus the friends of Job learnt simultaneously of his misfortune, and they hastened to his assistance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The four friends were related to one another, and each one was related to Job. Eliphaz, king of Teman, was a son of Esau; Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu were cousins, their fathers, Shuah, Naamat, and Barachel, were the sons of Buz, who was a brother of Job and a nephew of Abraham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the four friends arrived in the city in which Job lived, the inhabitants took them outside the gates, and pointing to a figure reclining upon an ash-heap at some distance off, they said, &quot;Yonder is Job.&quot; At first the friends would not give them credence, and they decided to look more closely at the man, to make sure of his identity. But the foul smell emanating from Job was so strong that they could not come near to him. They ordered their armies to scatter perfumes and aromatic substances all around. Only after this had been done for hours, they could approach the outcast close enough to recognize him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Eliphaz was the first to address Job, &quot;Art thou indeed Job, a king equal in rank with ourselves?&quot; And when Job said Aye, they broke out into lamentations and bitter tears, and all together they sang an elegy, the armies of the three kings, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, joining in the choir. Again Eliphaz began to speak, and he bemoaned Job&apos;s sad fortune, and depicted his friend&apos;s former glory, adding the refrain to each sentence, &quot;Whither hath departed the splendor of thy throne?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After listening long to the wailing and lamenting of Eliphaz and his companions, Job spake, saying: &quot;Silence, and I will show you my throne and the splendor of its glory. Kings will perish, rulers disappear, their pride and lustre will pass like a shadow </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">across a mirror, but my kingdom will persist forever and ever, for glory and magnificence are in the chariot of my Father.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These words aroused the wrath of Eliphaz, and he called upon his associates to abandon Job to his fate and go their way. But Bildad appeased his anger, reminding him that some allowance ought to be made for one so sorely tried as Job. Bildad put a number of questions to the sufferer in order to establish his sanity. He wanted to elicit from Job how it came about that God, upon whom he continued to set his hopes, could inflict such dire suffering. Not even a king of flesh and blood would allow a guardsman of his that had served him loyally to come to grief. Bildad desired to have information from Job also concerning the movements of the heavenly bodies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Job had but one answer to make to these questions: man cannot comprehend Divine wisdom, whether it reveal itself in inanimate and brute nature or in relation to human beings. &quot;But,&quot; continued Job, &quot;to prove to you that I am in my right mind, listen to the question I shall put to you. Solid food and liquids combine inside of man, and they separate again when they leave his body. Who effects the separation?&quot; And when Bildad conceded that he could not answer the question, Job said, &quot;If thou canst not comprehend the changes in thy body, how canst thou hope to comprehend the movements of the planets?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zophar, after Job had spoken thus to Bildad, was convinced that his suffering had had no effect upon his mind, and he asked him whether he would permit himself to be treated by the physicians of the three kings, his friends. But Job rejected the offer, saying, &quot;My healing and my restoration come from God, the Creator of all physicians.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">While the three kings were conversing thus with Job, his wife Zitidos made her appearance clad in rags, and she threw herself at the feet of her husband&apos;s friends, and amid tears she spoke, saying: &quot;O Eliphaz, and ye other friends of Job, remember what I was in other days, and how I am now changed, coming before you in rags and tatters.&quot; The sight of the unhappy woman touched them so deeply that they could </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">only weep, and not a word could they force out of their mouths. Eliphaz, however, took his royal mantle of purple, and laid it about the shoulders of the poor woman. Zitidos asked only one favor, that the three kings should order their soldiers to clear away the ruins of the building under which her children lay entombed, that she might give their remains decent burial. The command was issued to the soldiers accordingly, but Job said, &quot;Do not put yourselves to trouble for naught. My children will not be found, for they are safely bestowed with their Lord and Creator.&quot; Again his friends were sure that Job was bereft of his senses. He arose, however, prayed to God, and at the end of his devotions, he bade his friends look eastward, and when they did his bidding, they beheld his children next to the Ruler of heaven, with crowns of glory upon their heads. Zitidos prostrated herself, and said, &quot;Now I know that my memorial resides with the Lord.&quot; And she returned to the house of her master, whence she had absented herself for some time against his will. He had forbidden her to leave it, because he had feared that the three kings would take her with them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the evening she lay down to sleep next to the manger for the cattle, but she never rose again, she died there of exhaustion. The people of the city made a great mourning for her, and the elegy composed in her honor was set down in writing and recorded.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had spoken these words to Iyov, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to Elifaz the Teimani, “My anger is blazing against you and your two friends, because, unlike my servant Iyov, you have not spoken rightly about me. So now, get yourselves seven young bulls and seven rams, go to my servant Iyov, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. My servant Iyov will pray for you — because him I will accept — so that I won’t punish you as your boorishness deserves; because you have not spoken rightly about me, as my servant Iyov has.” So Elifaz the Teimani, Bildad the Shuchi and Tzofar the Na‘amati went and did what </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had ordered them to do, and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> accepted Iyov[’s prayer].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Iyov prayed for his friends, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> restored his fortunes; </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> gave Iyov twice as much as he had had before. Then all his brothers and sisters came to him, also all who had known him before, and they ate a meal with him in his house. They consoled and comforted him for all the evils </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had inflicted on him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> blessed Iyov’s later situation even more than his earlier one — he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of oxen and 1,000 female donkeys.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">He also had seven sons and three daughters. The first he named Y’mimah; the second, K’tzi‘ah; and the third, Keren-Hapukh. Nowhere in the land could women be found as beautiful as Iyov’s daughters; and their father gave them inheritances along with their brothers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">After this, Iyov lived 140 years, long enough to see his sons and grandsons, four generations. Then, old and full of days, Iyov died.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P28">More and more the friends of Job came to the conclusion that he had incurred Divine punishment on account of his sins, and as he asseverated his innocence again and again, they prepared angrily to leave him to his fate. Especially Elihu was animated by Satan to speak scurrilous words against Job, upbraiding him for his unshakable confidence in God. Then the Lord appeared to them, first unto Job, and revealed to him that Elihu was in the wrong, and his words were inspired by Satan. Next he appeared unto Eliphaz, and to him He spake thus: &quot;Thou and thy friends Bildad and Zophar have committed a sin, for ye did not speak the truth concerning my servant Job. Rise up and let him bring a sin offering for you. Only for his sake do I refrain from destroying you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">The sacrifice offered by Job in behalf of his friends was accepted graciously by God, and Eliphaz broke out into a hymn of thanksgiving to the Lord for having pardoned the transgression of himself and his two friends. At the same time he announced the damnation of Elihu, the instrument of Satan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:soft-page-break/>God appeared to Job once more, and gave him a girdle composed of three ribands, and he bade him tie it around his waist. Hardly had he put it on when all his pain disappeared, his very recollection of it vanished, and, more than this, God made him to see all that ever was and all that shall ever be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">After suffering sevenfold pain for seven years Job was restored to strength. With his three friends he returned to the city, and the inhabitants made a festival in his honor and unto the glory of God. All his former friends joined him again, and he resumed his old occupation, the care of the poor, for which he obtained the means from the people around. He said to them, &quot;Give me, each one of you, a sheep for the clothing of the poor, and four silver or gold drachmas for their other needs.&quot; The Lord blessed Job, and in a few days his wealth had increased to double the substance he had owned before misfortune overtook him. Zitidos having died during the years of his trials, he married a second wife, Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and she bore him seven sons and three daughters. He had never had more than one wife at a time, for he was wont to say, &quot;If it had been intended that Adam should have ten wives, God would have given them to him. Only one wife was bestowed upon him, whereby God indicated that he was to have but one, and therefore one wife suffices for me, too.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">When Job, after a long and happy life, felt his end approaching, he gathered his ten children around him, and told them the tale of his days. Having finished the narrative, he admonished them in these words: &quot;See, I am about to die, and you will stand in my place. Forsake not the Lord, be generous toward the poor, treat the feeble with consideration, and do not marry with the women of the Gentiles.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Thereupon he divided his possessions among his sons, and to his daughters he gave what is more precious than all earthly goods, to each of them one riband of the celestial girdle he had received from God. The magic virtue of these ribands was such that no sooner did their possessors tie them around their waists than they were transformed into higher beings, and with seraphic voices they broke out into hymns after the manner of the angels.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:soft-page-break/>For three days Job lay upon his bed, sick though not suffering, for the celestial girdle made him proof against pain. On the fourth day he saw the angels descend to fetch his soul. He arose from his bed, handed a cithern to his oldest daughter Jemimah, &quot;Day,&quot; a censer to the second one, Keziah, &quot;Perfume,&quot; and a cymbal to the third, Amaltheas, &quot;Horn,&quot; and bade them welcome the angels with the sound of music. They played and sang and praised the Lord in the holy tongue. Then he appeared that sits in the great chariot, kissed Job, and rode away bearing his soul with him eastward. None saw them depart except the three daughters of Job.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">The grief of the people, especially the poor, the widows, and the orphans, was exceeding great. For three days they left the corpse unburied, because they could not entertain the thought of separating themselves from it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">As the name of Job will remain imperishable unto all time, by reason of the man&apos;s piety, so his three friends were recompensed by God for their sympathy with him in his distress. Their names were preserved, the punishment of hell was remitted unto them, and, best of all, God poured out the holy spirit over them. But Satan, the cause of Job&apos;s anguish, the Lord cast down from heaven, for he had been vanquished by Job, who amid his agony had thanked and praised God for all He had done unto him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Sarah lived to be 127 years old; these were the years of Sarah’s life. Sarah died in Kiryat-Arba, also known as Hevron, in the land of Kena‘an; and Avraham came to mourn Sarah and weep for her. Then he got up from his dead one and said to the sons of Het, “I am a foreigner living as an alien with you; let me have a burial site with you, so that I can bury my dead wife.” The sons of Het answered Avraham, “Listen to us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us, so choose any of our tombs to bury your dead — not one of us would refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Avraham got up, bowed before the people of the land, the sons of Het, and spoke with them. “If it is your desire to help me bury my dead, then listen to me: ask ‘Efron the son of Tzochar to give me the cave of Makhpelah, which he owns, the one at the end of his field. He should sell it to me in your presence at its full value; then I will have a burial site of my own.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">‘Efron the Hitti was sitting among the sons of Het, and he gave Avraham his answer in the presence of the sons of Het who belonged to the ruling council of the city: “No, my lord, listen to me: I’m giving you the field, with its cave — I’m giving it to you. In the presence of my people I give it to you.” Avraham bowed before the people of the land and spoke to ‘Efron in their hearing: “Please be good enough to listen to me. I will pay the price of the field; accept it from me, and I will bury my dead there.” But ‘Efron answered Avraham, “My lord, listen to me. A plot of land worth 400 silver </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">shekel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">s — what is that between me and you? Just bury your dead.” Avraham got the point of what ‘Efron had said, so he weighed out for ‘Efron the amount of money he had specified in the presence of the sons of Het, 400 silver </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">shekel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">s of the weight accepted among merchants [ten pounds].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Thus the field of ‘Efron in Makhpelah, which is by Mamre — the field, its cave and all the trees in and around it — were deeded to Avraham as his possession in the presence of the sons of Het who belonged to the ruling council of the city.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Then Avraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Makhpelah, by Mamre, also known as Hevron, in the land of Kena‘an. The field and its cave had been purchased by Avraham from the sons of Het as a burial-site which would belong to him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">By now Avraham was old, advanced in years; and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had blessed Avraham in everything. Avraham said to the servant who had served him the longest, who was in charge of all he owned, “Put your hand under my thigh; because I want you to swear by </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son from among the women of the Kena‘ani, among whom I am living; but that you will go to my homeland, to my kinsmen, to choose a wife for my son Yitz’chak.” The servant replied, “Suppose the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land. Must I then bring your son back to the land from which you came?” Avraham said to him, “See to it that you don’t bring my son back there. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, the God of heaven — who took me away from my father’s house and away from the land I was born in, who spoke to me and swore to me, ‘I will give this land to your descendants’ — he will send his angel ahead of you; and you are to bring a wife for my son from there. But if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from your obligation under my oath. Just don’t bring my son back there.” The servant put his hand under the thigh of Avraham his master and swore to him concerning the matter.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and all kinds of gifts from his master, got up and went to Aram-Naharayim, to Nachor’s city. Toward evening, when the women go out to draw water, he had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well. He said, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, God of my master Avraham, please let me succeed today; and show your grace to my master Avraham. Here I am, standing by the spring, as the daughters of the townsfolk come out to draw water. I will say to one of the girls, ‘Please lower your jug, so that I can drink.’ If she answers, ‘Yes, drink; and I will water your camels as well,’ then let her be the one you intend for your servant Yitz’chak. This is how I will know that you have shown grace to my master.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Before he had finished speaking, Rivkah the daughter of B’tu’el son of Milkah the wife of Nachor Avraham’s brother, came out with her jug on her shoulder. The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, never having had sexual relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jug and came up. The servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a sip of water from your jug to drink.” “Drink, my lord,” she replied, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and immediately lowered her jug onto her arm and let him drink. When she was through letting him drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have drunk their fill.” She quickly emptied her jug into the trough, then ran again to the well to draw water, and kept on drawing water for all his camels. The man gazed at her in silence, waiting to find out whether </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had made his trip successful or not.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the camels were done drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing one-fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces and asked, “Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” She answered, “I am the daughter of B’tu’el the son Milkah bore to Nachor,” adding, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, and room for staying overnight.” The man bowed his head and prostrated himself before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then he said, “Blessed be </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, God of my master Avraham, who has not abandoned his faithful love for my master; because </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has guided me to the house of my master’s kinsmen.” The girl ran off and told her mother’s household what had happened.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Rivkah had a brother named Lavan. When he saw the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists besides, and when he heard his sister Rivkah’s report of what the man had said to her, he ran out to the spring and found the man standing there by the camels. “Come on in,” he said, “you whom </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has blessed! Why are you standing outside when I have made room in the house and prepared a place for the camels?” So the man went inside, and while the camels were being unloaded and provided straw and fodder, water was brought for him to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But when a meal was set before him, he said, “I won’t eat until I say what I have to say.” Lavan said, “Speak.” He said, “I am Avraham’s servant. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has greatly blessed my master, so that he has grown wealthy. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys. Sarah my master’s wife bore my master a son when she was old, and he has given him everything he has. My master made me swear, saying, ‘You are not to choose a wife for my son from among the women of the Kena‘ani, among whom I am living; rather, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">you are to go to my father’s house, to my kinsmen, to choose a wife for my son.’ I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman isn’t willing to follow me.’ Avraham answered me, ‘</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, in whose presence I live, will send his angel with you to make your trip successful; and you are to pick a wife for my son from my kinsmen in my father’s house; this will release you from your obligation under my oath. But if, when you come to my kinsmen, they refuse to give her to you, this too will release you from my oath.’</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">“So today, I came to the spring and said, ‘</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, God of my master Avraham, if you are causing my trip to succeed in its purpose, then, here I am, standing by the spring. I will say to one of the girls coming out to draw water, “Let me have a sip of water from your jug.” If she answers, “Yes, drink; and I will water your camels as well,” then let her be the woman you intend for my master’s son.’ And even before I had finished speaking to my heart, there came Rivkah, going out with her jug on her shoulder; she went down to the spring and drew water. When I said to her, ‘Please let me have a drink,’ she immediately lowered the jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’ So I drank, and she had the camels drink too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">“I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ and she answered, ‘The daughter of B’tu’el son of Nachor, whom Milkah bore to him.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists, bowed my head, prostrated myself before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and blessed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, God of my master Avraham, for having led me in the right way to obtain my master’s brother’s [grand]daughter for his son.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“So now if you people intend to show grace and truth to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I can turn elsewhere.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Lavan and B’tu’el replied, “Since this comes from </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, we can’t say anything to you either bad or good. Rivkah is here in front of you; take her and go. Let her be your master’s son’s wife, as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has said.” When Avraham’s servant heard what they said, he prostrated himself on the ground to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then the servant brought out silver and gold jewelry, together with clothing, and gave them to Rivkah. He also gave valuable gifts to her brother and mother. He and his men then ate and drank and stayed the night.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the morning they got up; and he said, “Send me off to my master.” Her brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that, she will go.” He answered them, “Don’t delay me, since </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has made my trip successful, but let me go back to my master.” They said, “We will call the girl and see what she says.” They called Rivkah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” and she replied, “I will.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">So they sent their sister Rivkah away, with her nurse, Avraham’s servant and his men. They blessed Rivkah with these words: “Our sister, may you be the mother of millions, and may your descendants possess the cities of those who hate them.” Then Rivkah and her maids mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rivkah and went on his way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Meanwhile, Yitz’chak, one evening after coming along the road from Be’er-Lachai-Ro’i — he was living in the Negev — went out walking in the field; and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. Rivkah too looked up; and when she saw Yitz’chak, she quickly dismounted the camel. She said to the servant, “Who is this man walking in the field to meet us?” When the servant replied, “It’s my master,” she took her veil and covered herself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The servant told Yitz’chak everything he had done. Then Yitz’chak brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent and took Rivkah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. Thus was Yitz’chak comforted for the loss of his mother.</text:p>

The sons of D’dan were Ashurim, L’tushim and L’umim. The sons of Midyan were ‘Eifah, ‘Efer, Hanokh, Avida and Elda‘ah. All these were descendants of K’turah.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Avraham gave everything he owned to Yitz’chak. But to the sons of the concubines he made grants while he was still living and sent them off to the east, to the land of Kedem, away from Yitz’chak his son.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This is how long Avraham lived: 175 years. Then Avraham breathed his last, dying at a ripe old age, an old man full of years; and he was gathered to his people.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Here is the history of Yitz’chak, Avraham’s son. Avraham fathered Yitz’chak. Yitz’chak was forty years old when he took Rivkah, the daughter of B’tu’el the Arami from Paddan-Aram and sister of Lavan the Arami, to be his wife. Yitz’chak prayed to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> heeded his prayer, and Rivkah became pregnant. The children fought with each other inside her so much that she said, “If it’s going to be like this, why go on living?” So she went to inquire of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, who answered her, “There are two nations in your womb. From birth they will be two rival peoples. One of these peoples will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the time for her delivery came, there were twins in her womb. The first to come out was reddish and covered all over with hair, like a coat; so they named him ‘Esav [completely formed, that is, having hair already]. Then his brother emerged, with his hand holding ‘Esav’s heel, so he was called Ya‘akov [he catches by the heel, he supplants]. Yitz’chak was sixty years old when she bore them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The boys grew; and ‘Esav became a skillful hunter, an outdoorsman; while Ya‘akov was a quiet man who stayed in the tents. Yitz’chak favored ‘Esav, because he had a taste for game; Rivkah favored Ya‘akov.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One day when Ya‘akov had cooked some stew, ‘Esav came in from the open country, exhausted, and said to Ya‘akov, “Please! Let me gulp down some of that red stuff — that red stuff! I’m exhausted!” (This is why he was called Edom [red].) Ya‘akov answered, “First sell me your rights as the firstborn.” “Look, I’m about to die!” said ‘Esav. “What use to me are my rights as the firstborn?” Ya‘akov said, “First, swear to me!” So he swore to him, thus selling his birthright to Ya‘akov. Then Ya‘akov gave him bread and lentil stew; he ate and drank, got up and went on his way. Thus ‘Esav showed how little he valued his birthright.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">A famine came over the land, not the same as the first famine, which had taken place when Avraham was alive. Yitz’chak went to G’rar, to Avimelekh king of the P’lishtim. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> appeared to him and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt, but live where I tell you. Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you, because I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants. I will fulfill the oath which I swore to Avraham your father — I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, I will give all these lands to your descendants, and by your descendants all the nations of the earth will bless themselves. All this is because Avraham heeded what I said and did what I told him to do — he followed my </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">mitzvot</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, my regulations and my teachings.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So Yitz’chak settled in G’rar. The men of the place asked him about his wife, and out of fear he said, “She is my sister.” He thought, “If I tell them she’s my wife, they might kill me in order to take Rivkah. After all, she is a beautiful woman.” But one day, after he had lived there a long time, Avimelekh king of the P’lishtim happened to be looking out of a window when he spotted Yitz’chak caressing Rivkah his wife. Avimelekh summoned Yitz’chak and said, “So she is your wife, after all! How come you said, ‘She is my sister’?” Yitz’chak responded, “Because I thought, ‘I could get killed because of her.’” Avimelekh said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!” Then Avimelekh warned all the people: “Whoever touches this man or his wife will certainly be put to death.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yitz’chak planted crops in that land and reaped that year a hundred times as much as he had sowed. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had blessed him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> The man became rich and prospered more and more, until he had become very wealthy indeed. He had flocks, cattle and a large household; and the P’lishtim envied him. Now the P’lishtim had stopped up and filled with dirt all the wells his father’s servants had dug during the lifetime of Avraham his father. Avimelekh said to Yitz’chak, “You must go away from us, because you have become much more powerful than we are.” So Yitz’chak left, set up camp in </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Vadi</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> G’rar and lived there. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yitz’chak reopened the wells which had been dug during the lifetime of Avraham his father, the ones the P’lishtim had stopped up after Avraham died, and called them by the names his father had used for them. Yitz’chak’s servants dug in the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">vadi</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and uncovered a spring of running water. But the herdsmen of G’rar quarreled with Yitz’chak’s herdsmen, claiming, “That water is ours!” So he called the well ‘Esek [quarrel], because they quarreled with him. They dug another well and quarreled over that one too. So he called it Sitnah [enmity]. He went away from there and dug another well, and over that one they didn’t quarrel. So he called it Rechovot [wide open spaces] and said, “Because now </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has made room for us, and we will be productive in the land.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> From there Yitz’chak went up to Be’er-Sheva. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> appeared to him that same night and said, “I am the God of Avraham your father. Don’t be afraid, because I am with you; I will bless you and increase your descendants for the sake of my servant Avraham.” There he built an altar and called on the name of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">. He pitched his tent there, and there Yitz’chak’s servants dug a well.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Avimelekh went to him from G’rar with his friend Achuzat and Pikhol the commander of his army. Yitz’chak said to them, “Why have you come to me, even though you were unfriendly to me and sent me away?” They answered, “We saw very clearly that </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has been with you; so we said, ‘Let there be an oath between us: let’s make a pact between ourselves and you that you will not harm us, just as we have not caused you offense but have done you nothing but good and sent you on your way in peace. Now you are blessed by </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">.’”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Yitz’chak prepared a banquet for them, and they ate and drank. The next morning, they got up early and swore to each other. Then Yitz’chak sent them on their way, and they left him peacefully. That very day Yitz’chak’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, “We have found water.” So he called it Shiv‘ah [oath, seven], and for this reason the name of the city is Be’er-Sheva [well of seven, well of an oath] to this day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When ‘Esav was forty years old, he took as wives Y’hudit the daughter of Be’eri the Hitti and Basmat the daughter of Elon the Hitti. But they became a cause for embitterment of spirit to Yitz’chak and Rivkah.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_s3qnd55wof5y"/>Genesis 27</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the course of time, after Yitz’chak had grown old and his eyes dim, so that he couldn’t see, he called ‘Esav his older son and said to him, “My son?” and he answered, “Here I am.” “Look, I’m old now, I don’t know when I will die. Therefore, please take your hunting gear — your quiver of arrows and your bow; go out in the country, and get me some game. Make it tasty, the way I like it; and bring it to me to eat. Then I will bless you [as firstborn], before I die.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Rivkah was listening when Yitz’chak spoke to his son ‘Esav. So when ‘Esav went out to the country to hunt for game and bring it back, she said to her son Ya‘akov, “Listen! I heard your father telling ‘Esav your brother, ‘Bring me game, and make it tasty, so I can eat it. Then I will give you my blessing in the presence of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, before my death.’ Now pay attention to me, my son; and do what I tell you. Go to the flock, and bring me back two choice kids. I will make it tasty for your father, the way he likes it; and you will bring it to your father to eat; so that he will give his blessing to you before his death.” Ya‘akov answered Rivkah his mother, “Look, ‘Esav is hairy, but I have smooth skin. Suppose my father touches me — he’ll know I’m trying to trick him, and I’ll bring a curse on myself, not a blessing!” But his mother said, “Let your curse be on me. Just listen to me, and go get me the kids!” So he went, got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared them in the tasty way his father loved. Next, Rivkah took ‘Esav her older son’s best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on Ya‘akov her younger son; and she put the skins of the goats on his hands and on the smooth parts of his neck. Then she gave the tasty food and the bread she had prepared to her son Ya‘akov.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">He went to his father and said, “My father?” He replied, “Here I am; who are you, my son?” Ya‘akov said to his father, “I am ‘Esav your firstborn. I’ve done what you asked me to do. Get up now, sit down, eat the game, and then give me your blessing.” Yitz’chak said to his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> your God made it happen that way.” Yitz’chak said to Ya‘akov, “Come here, close to me, so I can touch you, my son, and know whether you are in fact my son ‘Esav or not.” Ya‘akov approached Yitz’chak his father, who touched him and said, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">“The voice is Ya‘akov’s voice, but the hands are ‘Esav’s hands.” However, he didn’t detect him; because his hands were hairy like his brother ‘Esav’s hands; so he gave him his blessing. He asked, “Are you really my son ‘Esav?” And he replied, “I am.” He said, “Bring it here to me, and I will eat my son’s game, so that I can give you my blessing.” So he brought it up to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank. Then his father Yitz’chak said to him, “Come close now, and kiss me, my son.” He approached and kissed him. Yitz’chak smelled his clothes and blessed Ya‘akov with these words: “See, my son smells like a field which </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has blessed. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So may God give you dew from heaven, the richness of the earth, and grain and wine in abundance. May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. May you be lord over your kinsmen, let your mother’s descendants bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But as soon as Yitz’chak had finished giving his blessing to Ya‘akov, when Ya‘akov had barely left his father’s presence, ‘Esav his brother came in from his hunting. He too had prepared a tasty meal and brought it to his father, and now he said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat from his son’s game, so that you may give me your blessing.” Yitz’chak his father said to him, “Who are you?” and he answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, ‘Esav.” Yitz’chak began trembling uncontrollably and said, “Then who was it that took game and brought it to me? I ate it all just before you came, and I gave my blessing to him. That’s the truth, and the blessing must stand.” When ‘Esav heard his father’s words he burst into loud, bitter sobbing. “Father, bless me too,” he begged. He replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took away your blessing.” ‘Esav said, “His name, Ya‘akov [he supplants], really suits him — because he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and here, now he has taken away my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” Yitz’chak answered ‘Esav, “Look, I have made him your lord, I have given him all his kinsmen as servants, and I have given him grain and wine to sustain him. What else is there that I can do for you, my son?” ‘Esav said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Father, bless me too!” ‘Esav wept aloud, and Yitz’chak his father answered him: “Here! Your home will be of the richness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above. You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. But when you break loose, you will shake his yoke off your neck.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>‘Esav hated his brother because of the blessing his father had given him. ‘Esav said to himself, “The time for mourning my father will soon come, and then I will kill my brother Ya‘akov.” But the words of ‘Esav her older son were told to Rivkah. She sent for Ya‘akov her younger son and said to him, “Here, your brother ‘Esav is comforting himself over you by planning to kill you. Therefore, my son, listen to me: get up and escape to Lavan my brother in Haran. Stay with him a little while, until your brother’s anger subsides. Your brother’s anger will turn away from you, and he will forget what you did to him. Then I’ll send and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you on the same day?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Rivkah said to Yitz’chak, “I’m sick to death of Hitti women! If Ya‘akov marries one of the Hitti women, like those who live here, my life won’t be worth living.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_o0crvnvrv04s"/>Genesis 28</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">So Yitz’chak called Ya‘akov, and, after blessing him, charged him: “You are not to choose a wife from the Hitti women. Go now to the home of B’tu’el your mother’s father, and choose a wife there from the daughters of Lavan your mother’s brother. May </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">El Shaddai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> bless you, make you fruitful and increase your descendants, until they become a whole assembly of peoples. And may he give you the blessing which he gave Avraham, you and your descendants with you, so that you will possess the land you will travel through, the land God gave to Avraham.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So Yitz’chak sent Ya‘akov away; and he went to Paddan-Aram, to Lavan, son of B’tu’el the Arami, the brother of Rivkah Ya‘akov’s and ‘Esav’s mother. Now ‘Esav saw that Yitz’chak had blessed Ya‘akov and sent him away to Paddan-Aram to choose a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he charged him, “You are not to choose a Kena‘ani woman as your wife,” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and that Ya‘akov had listened to his father and mother and gone to Paddan-Aram. ‘Esav also saw that the Kena‘ani women did not please Yitz’chak his father. So ‘Esav went to Yishma‘el and took, in addition to the wives he already had, Machalat the daughter of Yishma‘el Avraham’s son, the sister of N’vayot, to be his wife.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ya‘akov went out from Be’er-Sheva and traveled toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed the night there, because the sun had set. He took a stone from the place, put it under his head and lay down there to sleep. He dreamt that there before him was a ladder resting on the ground with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> were going up and down on it. Then suddenly </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> was standing there next to him; and he said, “I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, the God of Avraham your [grand]father and the God of Yitz’chak. The land on which you are lying I will give to you and to your descendants. Your descendants will be as numerous as the grains of dust on the earth. You will expand to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. By you and your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed. Look, I am with you. I will guard you wherever you go, and I will bring you back into this land, because I won’t leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ya‘akov awoke from his sleep and said, “Truly, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> is in this place — and I didn’t know it!” Then he became afraid and said, “This place is fearsome! This has to be the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!” Ya‘akov got up early in the morning, took the stone he had put under his head, set it up as a standing-stone, poured olive oil on its top and named the place Beit-El [house of God]; but the town had originally been called Luz.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ya‘akov took this vow: “If God will be with me and will guard me on this road that I am traveling, giving me bread to eat and clothes to wear, so that I return to my father’s house in peace, then </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> will be my God; and this stone, which I have set up as a standing-stone, will be God’s house; and of everything you give me, I will faithfully return one-tenth to you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_l36eytfm0gm4"/>Genesis 29</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Continuing his journey, Ya‘akov came to the land of the people of the east. As he looked, he saw a well in a field; and there were three flocks of sheep lying there next to it; because they watered the sheep from that well. The stone on the well’s mouth was large, and only when all the flocks had gathered there would they roll the stone away from the opening of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place on the well’s opening.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” They answered, “We’re from Haran.” He asked them, “Do you know Lavan the [grand]son of Nachor?” They said, “We do.” He asked them, “Are things going well with him?” “Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.” He said, “Look, there’s still plenty of daylight left; and it isn’t time to bring the animals home; so water the sheep; then go, and put them out to pasture.” They answered, “We can’t, not until all the flocks have been gathered together, and they roll the stone away from the opening of the well. That’s when we water the sheep.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, because she took care of them. When Ya‘akov saw Rachel the daughter of Lavan his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother, Ya‘akov went up and rolled the stone away from the opening of the well and watered the flock of Lavan his mother’s brother. Ya‘akov kissed Rachel and wept aloud. Ya‘akov told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rivkah’s son; and she ran and told her father. When Lavan heard the news of Ya‘akov his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, hugged him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Ya‘akov told Lavan all that had happened. Lavan said to him, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After Ya‘akov had stayed with him for a whole month, Lavan said to him, “Why should you work for me for nothing, just because you are my relative? Tell me how much I should pay you.” Now Lavan had two daughters; the name of the older was Le’ah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Le’ah’s eyes were weak; but Rachel was good-looking, with beautiful features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Ya‘akov had fallen in love with Rachel and said, “I will work for you seven years in exchange for Rachel your younger daughter.” Lavan answered, “Better that I give her to you than to someone else; stay with me.” So Ya‘akov worked seven years for Rachel, and it seemed only a few days to him, because he was so much in love with her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov said to Lavan, “Give me my wife, since my time is finished, so that I can start living with her.” Lavan gathered all the men of the place and gave a banquet. In the evening he took Le’ah his daughter and brought her to Ya‘akov, and he went in and slept with her. Lavan also gave his slave-girl Zilpah to his daughter Le’ah as her slave-girl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the morning Ya‘akov saw that he was with Le’ah, and he said to Lavan, “What kind of thing is this that you’ve done to me? Didn’t I work for you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?” Lavan answered, “In our place that isn’t how it’s done, to give the younger daughter before the firstborn. Finish the marriage week of this one, and we’ll give you the other one also in exchange for the work you will do for me during yet another seven years.” Ya‘akov agreed to this, so he finished her week, and Lavan gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. Lavan also gave to his daughter Rachel his slave-girl Bilhah as her slave-girl. So not only did Ya‘akov go in and sleep with Rachel, but he also loved Rachel more than Le’ah. Then he served Lavan another seven years.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> saw that Le’ah was unloved, so he made her fertile, while Rachel remained childless. Le’ah conceived and gave birth to a son, whom she named Re’uven [see, a son!], for she said, “It is because </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has seen how humiliated I have been, but now my husband will love me.” She conceived again, gave birth to a son and said, “It is because </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has heard that I am unloved; therefore he has given me this son also.” So she named him Shim‘on [hearing]. Once more she conceived and had a son; and she said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore she named him Levi [joining]. She conceived yet again, had a son and said, “This time I will praise </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">”; therefore she named him Y’hudah [praise]. Then she stopped having children.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Rachel saw that she was not bearing children for Ya‘akov, she envied her sister and said to Ya‘akov, “Give me children, or I will die!” This made Ya‘akov angry at Rachel; he answered, “Am I in God’s place? He’s the one who is denying you children.” She said, “Here is my maid Bilhah. Go, sleep with her, and let her give birth to a child that will be laid on my knees, so that through her I too can build a family.” So she gave him Bilhah her slave-girl as his wife, and Ya‘akov went in and slept with her. Bilhah conceived and bore Ya‘akov a son. Rachel said, “God has judged in my favor; indeed he has heard me and given me a son.” Therefore she called him Dan [he judged].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Bilhah Rachel’s slave-girl conceived again and bore Ya‘akov a second son. Rachel said, “I have wrestled mightily with my sister and won,” and called him Naftali [my wrestling].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Le’ah saw that she had stopped having children, she took Zilpah her slave-girl and gave her to Ya‘akov as his wife. Zilpah Le’ah’s slave-girl bore Ya‘akov a son; and Le’ah said, “Good fortune has come,” calling him Gad [good fortune].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zilpah Le’ah’s slave-girl bore Ya‘akov a second son; and Le’ah said, “How happy I am! Women will say I am happy!” and called him Asher [happy].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> During the wheat harvest season Re’uven went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Le’ah. Rachel said to Le’ah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes [so that I can be fertile].” She answered, “Isn’t it enough that you have taken away my husband? Do you have to take my son’s mandrakes too?” Rachel said, “Very well; in exchange for your son’s mandrakes, sleep with him tonight.” When Ya‘akov came in from the field in the evening, Le’ah went out to meet him and said, “You have to come and sleep with me, because I’ve hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So Ya‘akov slept with her that night. God listened to Le’ah, and she conceived and bore Ya‘akov a fifth son. Le’ah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my slave-girl to my husband.” So she called him Yissakhar [hire, reward].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Le’ah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Ya‘akov. Le’ah said, “God has given me a wonderful gift. Now at last my husband will live with me, since I have borne him six sons.” And she called him Z’vulun [living together].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After this, she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah [controversy over rights].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then God took note of Rachel, heeded her prayer and made her fertile. She conceived, had a son and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” She called him Yosef [may he add], saying, “May </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> add to me another son.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After Rachel had given birth to Yosef, Ya‘akov said to Lavan, “Send me on my way, so that I can return to my own place, to my own country. Let me take my wives, for whom I have served you, and my children; and let me go. You know very well how faithfully I have served you.” Lavan answered him, “If you regard me favorably, then please listen: I have observed the signs that </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has blessed me on account of you. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Name your wages,” he said; “I will pay them.” Ya‘akov replied, “You know how faithfully I have served you and how your livestock have prospered under my care. The few you had before I came have increased substantially; </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has blessed you wherever I went. But now, when will I provide for my own household?” Lavan said, “What should I give you?” “Nothing,” answered Ya‘akov, “just do this one thing for me: once more I will pasture your flock and take care of it. I will also go through the flock and pick out every speckled, spotted or brown sheep, and every speckled or spotted goat; these and their offspring will be my wages. And I will let my integrity stand as witness against me in the future: when you come to look over the animals constituting my wages, every goat that isn’t speckled or spotted and every sheep that isn’t brown will count as stolen by me.” Lavan replied, “As you have said, so be it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">That day Lavan removed the male goats that were streaked or spotted and all the female goats that were speckled or spotted, every one with white on it, and all the brown sheep; turned them over to his sons; and put three days’ distance between himself and Ya‘akov. Ya‘akov fed the rest of Lavan’s flocks.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Ya‘akov took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white streaks on them by peeling off the bark. Then he set the rods he had peeled upright in the watering troughs, so that the animals would see them when they came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink, the animals mated in sight of the rods and gave birth to streaked, speckled and spotted young. Ya‘akov divided the lambs and had the animals mate with the streaked and the brown in the flock of Lavan. He also kept his own livestock separate and did not have them mix with Lavan’s flock. Whenever the hardier animals came into heat, Ya‘akov would set up the rods in the watering troughs; so that the animals would see them and conceive in front of them; but he didn’t set up the rods in front of the weaker animals. Thus the more feeble were Lavan’s and the stronger Ya‘akov’s. In this way the man became very rich and had large flocks, along with male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_uoix2txx2pmw"/>Genesis 31</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But then he heard what Lavan’s sons were saying: “Ya‘akov has taken away everything that our father once had. It’s from what used to belong to our father that he has gotten so rich.” He also saw that Lavan regarded him differently than before. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to Ya‘akov, “Return to the land of your ancestors, to your kinsmen; I will be with you.” So Ya‘akov sent for Rachel and Le’ah and had them come to the field where his flock was. He said to them, “I see by the way your father looks that he feels differently toward me than before; but the God of my father has been with me. You know that I have served your father with all my strength, and that your father has belittled me and has changed my wages ten times; but God did not allow him to do me any damage. If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to streaked young. This is how God has taken away your father’s animals and given them to me. Once, when the animals were mating, I had a dream: I looked up and there in front of me the male goats which mated with the females were streaked, speckled and mottled. Then, in the dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Ya‘akov!’ and I replied, ‘Here I am.’ He continued, ‘Raise your eyes now, and look: all the male goats mating with the females are streaked, speckled and mottled; for I have seen everything Lavan has been doing to you. I am the God of Beit-El, where you anointed a standing-stone with oil, where you vowed your vow to me. Now get up, get out of this land, and return to the land where you were born.’” Rachel and Le’ah answered him, “We no longer have any inheritance from our father’s possessions; and he considers us foreigners, since he has sold us; moreover, he has consumed everything he received in exchange for us. Nevertheless, the wealth which God has taken away from our father has become ours and our children’s anyway; so whatever God has told you to do, do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then Ya‘akov got up, put his sons and wives on the camels, and carried off all his livestock, along with all the riches he had accumulated, the livestock in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-Aram, to go to Yitz’chak his father in the land of Kena‘an.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Now Lavan had gone to shear his sheep, so Rachel stole the household idols that belonged to her father, and Ya‘akov outwitted Lavan the Arami by not telling him of his intended flight. So he fled with everything he had: he departed, crossed the [Euphrates] River and set out for the hill-country of Gil‘ad. Not until the third day was Lavan told that Ya‘akov had fled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Lavan took his kinsmen with him and spent the next seven days pursuing Ya‘akov, overtaking him in the hill-country of Gil‘ad. But God came to Lavan the Arami in a dream that night and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t say anything to Ya‘akov, either good or bad.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Lavan caught up with Ya‘akov, Ya‘akov had set up camp in the hill-country; so Lavan and his kinsmen set up camp in the hill-country of Gil‘ad. Lavan said to Ya‘akov, “What do you mean by deceiving me and carrying off my daughters as if they were captives taken in war? Why did you flee in secret and deceive me and not tell me? I would have sent you off with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and lyres. You didn’t even let me kiss my sons and daughters good-bye! What a stupid thing to do! I have it in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night and said, ‘Be careful that you don’t say anything to Ya‘akov, either good or bad.’ Granted that you had to leave, because you longed so deeply for your father’s house; but why did you steal my gods?” Ya‘akov answered Lavan, “Because I was afraid. I said, ‘Suppose you take your daughters away from me by force?’ But if you find your gods with someone, that person will not remain alive. So with our kinsmen to witness, if you spot anything that I have which belongs to you, take it back.” Ya‘akov did not know that Rachel had stolen them. Lavan went into Ya‘akov’s tent, then into Le’ah’s tent and into the tent of the two slave-girls; but he did not find them. He left Le’ah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. Now Rachel had taken the household gods, put them in the saddle of the camel and was sitting on them. Lavan felt all around the tent but did not find them. She said to her father, “Please don’t be angry that I’m not getting up in your presence, but it’s the time of my period.” So he searched, but he didn’t find the household gods.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Ya‘akov became angry and started arguing with Lavan. “What have I done wrong?” he demanded. “What is my offense, that you have come after me in hot </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">pursuit? You have felt around in all my stuff, but what have you found of all your household goods? Put it here, in front of my kinsmen and yours, so that they can render judgment between the two of us! I have been with you for these twenty years! Your female sheep and goats haven’t aborted their young, and I haven’t eaten the male animals in your flocks. If one of your flock was destroyed by a wild animal, I didn’t bring the carcass to you but bore the loss myself. You demanded that I compensate you for any animal stolen, whether by day or by night. Here’s how it was for me: during the day thirst consumed me, and at night the cold — my sleep fled from my eyes. These twenty years I’ve been in your house — I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock; and you changed my wages ten times! If the God of my father, the God of Avraham, the one whom Yitz’chak fears, had not been on my side, by now you would certainly have already sent me away with nothing! God has seen how distressed I’ve been and how hard I’ve worked, and last night he passed judgment in my favor.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Lavan answered Ya‘akov, “The daughters are mine, the children are mine, the flocks are mine, and everything you see is mine! But what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne? So now, come, let’s make a covenant, I and you; and let it stand as a testimony between me and you.” Ya‘akov took a stone and set it upright as a standing-stone. Then Ya‘akov said to his kinsmen, “Gather some stones”; and they took stones, made a pile of them and ate there by the pile of stones. Lavan called it Y’gar-Sahaduta [“pile of witness” in Aramaic], while Ya‘akov called it Gal-‘Ed [“pile of witness” in Hebrew].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Lavan said, “This pile witnesses between me and you today.” This is why it is called Gal-‘Ed and also HaMitzpah [the watchtower], because he said, “May </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> watch between me and you when we are apart from each other. If you cause pain to my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, then, even if no one is there with us, still God is witness between me and you.” Lavan also said to Ya‘akov, “Here is this pile, and here is this standing-stone, which I have set up between me and you. May this pile be a witness, and may the standing-stone be a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile to you, and you will not pass beyond this pile and this standing-stone to me, to cause harm. May the God of Avraham and also the god of Nachor, the god of their father, judge between us.” But Ya‘akov swore by the One his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">father Yitz’chak feared. Ya‘akov offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his kinsmen to the meal. They ate the food and spent the whole night on the mountain.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Early in the morning Lavan got up, kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them. Then Lavan left and returned to his own place. Ya‘akov went on his way, and the angels of God met him. When Ya‘akov saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp,” and called that place Machanayim [two camps].</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov sent messengers ahead of him to ‘Esav his brother toward the land of Se‘ir, the country of Edom, with these instructions: “Here is what you are to say to my lord ‘Esav: ‘Your servant Ya‘akov says, “I have been living with Lavan and have stayed until now. I have cattle, donkeys and flocks, and male and female servants. I am sending to tell this news to my lord, in order to win your favor.” ’” The messengers returned to Ya‘akov saying, “We went to your brother ‘Esav, and he is coming to meet you; with him are four hundred men.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ya‘akov became greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people, flocks, cattle and camels with him into two camps, saying, “If ‘Esav comes to the one camp and attacks it, at least the camp that is left will escape.” Then Ya‘akov said, “God of my father Avraham and God of my father Yitz’chak, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, who told me, ‘Return to your country and your kinsmen, and I will do you good’: I’m not worthy of all the love and faithfulness you have shown your servant, since I crossed the Yarden with only my staff. But now I have become two camps. Please! Rescue me from my brother ‘Esav! I’m afraid of him, afraid he’ll come and attack me, without regard for mothers or children. You said, ‘I will certainly do you good and make your descendants as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea, which are so many they can’t be counted.’”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> He stayed there that night; then he chose from among his possessions the following as a present for ‘Esav his brother: two hundred female goats and twenty males, two hundred female sheep and twenty males, thirty milk-camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten colts. He turned them over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Cross over in front of me, and keep a space between each drove and the next one.” He instructed the servant in front, “When ‘Esav my brother meets you and asks you, ‘Whose servant </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">are you? Where are you going? And whose animals are these?’ then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Ya‘akov, and they are a present he has sent to my lord ‘Esav; and Ya‘akov himself is just behind us.’” He also instructed the second servant, and the third, and all that followed the droves, “When you encounter ‘Esav, you are to speak to him in the same way, and you are to add, ‘And there, just behind us, is your servant Ya‘akov.’” For he said, “I will appease him first with the present that goes ahead of me; then, after that, I will see him myself — and maybe he will be friendly toward me.” So the present crossed over ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He got up that night, took his two wives, his two slave-girls, and his eleven children, and forded the Yabok. He took them and sent them across the stream, then sent his possessions across; and Ya‘akov was left alone. Then some man wrestled with him until daybreak. When he saw that he did not defeat Ya‘akov, he struck Ya‘akov’s hip socket, so that his hip was dislocated while wrestling with him. The man said, “Let me go, because it’s daybreak.” But Ya‘akov replied, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.” The man asked, “What is your name?” and he answered, “Ya‘akov.” Then the man said, “From now on, you will no longer be called Ya‘akov, but Isra’el; because you have shown your strength to both God and men and have prevailed.” Ya‘akov asked him, “Please tell me your name.” But he answered, “Why are you asking about my name?” and blessed him there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Ya‘akov called the place P’ni-El [face of God], “Because I have seen God face to face, yet my life is spared.” As the sun rose upon him he went on past P’ni-El, limping at the hip. This is why, to this day, the people of Isra’el do not eat the thigh muscle that passes along the hip socket — because the man struck Ya‘akov’s hip at its socket.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov raised his eyes and looked out; and there was ‘Esav coming, and four hundred men with him. So Ya‘akov divided the children between Le’ah, Rachel and the two slave-girls, putting the slave-girls and their children first, Le’ah and her children second, and Rachel and Yosef last. Then he himself passed on ahead of them and prostrated himself on the ground seven times before approaching his brother. ‘Esav ran to meet him, hugged him, threw his arms around his neck and kissed him; and they wept. Esav looked up; on seeing the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” Ya‘akov answered, “The children God has graciously given to your servant.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then the slave-girls approached with their children, and they prostrated themselves; Le’ah too and her children approached and prostrated themselves; and last came Yosef and Rachel; and they prostrated themselves. ‘Esav asked, “What was the meaning of this procession of droves I encountered?” and he answered, “It was to win my lord’s favor.” ‘Esav replied, “I have plenty already; my brother, keep your possessions for yourself.” Ya‘akov said, “No, please! If now I have won your favor, then accept my gift. Just seeing your face has been like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me. So please accept the gift I have brought you, for God has dealt kindly with me and I have enough.” Thus he urged him, until he accepted it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">‘Esav said, “Let’s break camp and get going. I’ll go first.” Ya‘akov said to him, “My lord knows that the children are small, and the sheep and cattle suckling their young concern me, because if they overdrive them even one day, all the flocks will die. Instead, please, let my lord go on ahead of his servant. I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the cattle ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Se‘ir.” ‘Esav replied, “Then let me leave with you some of the people I have with me.” But Ya‘akov said, “There’s no need for my lord to be so kind to me.” So ‘Esav left that day to return to Se‘ir. Ya‘akov went on to Sukkot, where he built himself a house and put up shelters for his cattle. This is why the place is called Sukkot [shelters].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Having traveled from Paddan-Aram, Ya‘akov arrived safely at the city of Sh’khem, in Kena‘an, and set up camp near the city. From the sons of Hamor Sh’khem’s father he bought for one hundred pieces of silver the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent. There he put up an altar, which he called El-Elohei-Yisra’el [God, the God of Isra’el].</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_yt5vkpdy9scq"/>Genesis 34</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One time Dinah the daughter of Le’ah, whom she had borne to Ya‘akov, went out to visit the local girls; and Sh’khem the son of Hamor the Hivi, the local ruler, saw her, grabbed her, raped her and humiliated her. But actually he was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Ya‘akov; he fell in love with the girl and tried to win her affection. Sh’khem spoke with his father Hamor and said, “Get this girl for me; I want her to be my wife.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Ya‘akov heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Ya‘akov restrained himself until they came. Hamor the father of Sh’khem went out to Ya‘akov to speak with him just as Ya‘akov’s sons were coming in from the field. When they heard what had happened, the men were saddened and were very angry at the outrage this man had committed against Isra’el by raping Ya‘akov’s daughter, something that is simply not done. But Hamor said to them, “My son Sh’khem’s heart is set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife; and intermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. You will live with us, and the land will be available to you — you’ll live, do business and acquire possessions here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Sh’khem said to her father and brothers, “Only accept me, and I will give whatever you tell me. Ask as large a bride-price as you like, I’ll pay whatever you tell me. Just let me marry the girl.” The sons of Ya‘akov answered Sh’khem and Hamor his father deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. They said to them, “We can’t do it, because it would be a disgrace to give our sister to someone who hasn’t been circumcised. Only on this condition will we consent to what you are asking: that you become like us by having every male among you get circumcised. Then we’ll give our daughters to you, and we’ll take your daughters for ourselves, and we’ll live with you and become one people. But if you won’t do as we say and get circumcised, then we’ll take our daughter and go away.” What they said seemed fair to Hamor and Sh’khem the son of Hamor, and the young man did not put off doing what was asked of him, even though he was the most respected member of his father’s family, because he so much wanted Ya‘akov’ s daughter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Hamor and Sh’khem his son came to the entrance of their city and spoke with its leading men: “These people are peaceful toward us; therefore let them live in the land and do business in it; for, as you can see, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives for ourselves, and we’ll give them our daughters. But the people will consent to live with us and become one people only on this condition: that every male among us gets circumcised, as they themselves are circumcised. Won’t their cattle, their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s consent to do what they ask, and then they will live with us.” Everyone going out the city’s gate listened to Hamor and Sh’khem his son; so every male was circumcised, every one that went out the gate of the city.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On the third day after the circumcision, when they were in pain, two of Ya‘akov’s sons, Shim‘on and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords, boldly descended on the city and slaughtered all the males. They killed Hamor and Sh’khem his son with their swords, took Dinah out of Sh’khem’s house, and left. Then the sons of Ya‘akov entered over the dead bodies of those who had been slaughtered and plundered the city in reprisal for defiling their sister. They took their flocks, cattle and donkeys, and everything else, whether in the city or in the field, everything they owned. Their children and wives they took captive, and they looted whatever was in the houses.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Ya‘akov said to Shim‘on and Levi, “You have caused me trouble by making me stink in the opinion of the local inhabitants, the Kena‘ani and the P’rizi. Since I don’t have many people, they’ll align themselves together against me and attack me; and I will be destroyed, I and my household.” They replied, “Should we let our sister be treated like a whore?”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_yncbiv7tjezq"/>Genesis 35</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God said to Ya‘akov, “Get up, go up to Beit-El and live there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled ‘Esav your brother.” Then Ya‘akov said to his household and all the others with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that you have with you, purify yourselves, and put on fresh clothes. We’re going to move on and go up to Beit-El. There I will build an altar to God, who answered me when I was in such distress and stayed with me wherever I went.” They gave Ya‘akov all the foreign gods in their possession and the earrings they were wearing, and Ya‘akov buried them under the pistachio tree near Sh’khem. While they were traveling, a terror from God fell upon the cities around them, so that none of them pursued the sons of Ya‘akov.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov and all the people with him arrived at Luz (that is, Beit-El) in the land of Kena‘an. He built there an altar and called the place El-Beit-El [God of Beit-El], because it was there that God was revealed to him, at the time when he was fleeing from his brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then D’vorah, Rivkah’s nurse, died. She was buried below Beit-El under the oak, which was given the name Alon-Bakhut [oak of weeping].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After Ya‘akov arrived from Paddan-Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. God said to him, “Your name is Ya‘akov, but you will be called Ya‘akov no longer; your name will be Isra’el.” Thus he named him Isra’el. God further said to him, “I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">El Shaddai.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Be fruitful and multiply. A nation, indeed a group of nations, will come from you; kings will be descended from you. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(A: vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Moreover, the land which I gave to Avraham and Yitz’chak I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you.” Then God went up from him there where he had spoken with him. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(S: vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Ya‘akov set up a standing-stone in the place where he had spoken with him, a stone pillar. Then he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. Ya‘akov called the place where God spoke with him Beit-El.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then they traveled on from Beit-El, and while there was still some distance to go before arriving in Efrat, Rachel went into labor, and she had great difficulty with it. While she was undergoing this hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t worry, this </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">is also a son for you.” But she died in childbirth. As she was dying she named her son Ben-Oni [son of my grief], but his father called him Binyamin [son of the right hand, son of the south]. So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Efrat (that is, Beit-Lechem). Ya‘akov set up a standing-stone on her grave; it is the standing-stone of Rachel’s grave to this day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Isra’el continued his travels and pitched his tent on the other side of Migdal-‘Eder. It was while Isra’el was living in that land that Re’uven went and slept with Bilhah his father’s concubine, and Isra’el heard about it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ya‘akov had twelve sons. The sons of Le’ah were Re’uven Ya‘akov’s firstborn, Shim‘on, Levi, Y’hudah, Yissakhar and Z’vulun. The sons of Rachel were Yosef and Binyamin. The sons of Bilhah Rachel’s slave-girl were Dan and Naftali. And the sons of Zilpah Le’ah’s slave-girl were Gad and Asher.

Now Isra’el loved Yosef the most of all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long-sleeved robe.

   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Jacob was not exempt from the lot that falls to the share of all the pious. Whenever they expect to enjoy life in tranquillity, Satan hinders them. He appears before God, and says: &quot;Is it not enough that the future world is set apart for the pious? What right have they to enjoy this world, besides?&quot; After the many hardships and conflicts that had beset the path of Jacob, he thought he would be at rest at last, and then came the loss of Joseph and inflicted the keenest suffering. Verily, few and evil had been the days of the years of Jacob&apos;s pilgrimage, for the time spent outside of the Holy Land had seemed joyless to him. Only the portion of his life passed in the land of his fathers, during which he was occupied with making proselytes, in accordance with the example set him by Abraham and Isaac, did he consider worth while having lived, and this happy time was of short duration. When Joseph was snatched away, but eight years had elapsed since his return to his father&apos;s house.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">And yet it was only for the sake of Joseph that Jacob had been willing to undergo all the troubles and the adversity connected with his sojourn in the house of Laban. Indeed, Jacob&apos;s blessing in having his quiver full of children was due to the merits of Joseph, and likewise the dividing of the Red Sea and of the Jordan for the Israelites was the reward for his son&apos;s piety. For among the sons of Jacob Joseph was the one that resembled his father most closely in appearance, and, also, he was the one to whom Jacob transmitted the instruction and knowledge he had received from his teachers Shem and Eber. The whole course of the <text:soft-page-break/>son&apos;s life is but a repetition of the father&apos;s. As the mother of Jacob remained childless for a long time after her marriage, so also the mother of Joseph. As Rebekah had undergone severe suffering in giving birth to Jacob, so Rachel in giving birth to Joseph. As Jacob&apos;s mother bore two sons, so also Joseph&apos;s mother. Like Jacob, Joseph was born circumcised. As the father was a shepherd, so the son. As the father served for the sake of a woman, so the son served under a woman. Like the father, the son appropriated his older brother&apos;s birthright. The father was hated by his brother, and the son was hated by his brethren. The father was the favorite son as compared with his brother, so was the son as compared with his brethren. Both the father and the son lived in the land of the stranger. The father became a servant to a master, also the son. The master whom the father served was blessed by God, so was the master whom the son served. The father and the son were both accompanied by angels, and both married their wives outside of the Holy Land. The father and the son were both blessed with wealth. Great things were announced to the father in a dream, so also to the son. As the father went to Egypt and put an end to famine, so the son. As the father exacted the promise from his sons to bury him in the Holy Land, so also the son. The father died in Egypt, there died also the son. The body of the father was embalmed, also the body of the son. As the father&apos;s remains were carried to the Holy Land for interment, so also the remains of the son. Jacob the father provided for the sustenance of his son Joseph during a period of seventeen years, so Joseph the son provided for his father Jacob during a period of seventeen years.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Until he was seventeen years old, Joseph frequented the Bet ha-Midrash, and he became so learned that he could impart to his brethren the Halakot he had heard from his father, and in this way he may be regarded as their teacher. He did not stop at formal instruction, he also tried to give them good counsel, and he became the favorite of the sons of the handmaids, who would kiss and embrace him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">In spite of his scholarship there was something boyish about Joseph. He painted his eyes, dressed his hair carefully, and walked with a mincing step. These foibles of youth were not so deplorable as his habit of bringing evil reports of his brethren to his father. He accused them of treating the beasts under their care with cruelty--he said that they ate flesh torn from a living animal--and he charged them with casting their eyes upon the daughters of the Canaanites, and giving contemptuous treatment to the sons of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah, whom they called slaves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:soft-page-break/>For these groundless accusations Joseph had to pay dearly. He was himself sold as a slave, because he had charged his brethren with having called the sons of the handmaids slaves, and Potiphar&apos;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, because he threw the suspicion upon his brethren that they had cast their eyes upon the Canaanitish women. And how little it was true that they were guilty of cruelty to animals, appears from the fact that at the very time when they were contemplating their crime against Joseph, they yet observed all the rules and prescriptions of the ritual in slaughtering the kid of the goats with the blood of which they besmeared his coat of many colors.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yosef had a dream which he told his brothers, and that made them hate him all the more. He said to them, “Listen while I tell you about this dream of mine. We were tying up bundles of wheat in the field when suddenly my bundle got up by itself and stood upright; then your bundles came, gathered around mine and prostrated themselves before it.” His brothers retorted, “Yes, you will certainly be our king. You’ll do a great job of bossing us around!” And they hated him still more for his dreams and for what he said.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P22">Joseph&apos;s talebearing against his brethren made them hate him. Among all of them Gad was particularly wrathful, and for good reason. Gad was a very brave man, and when a beast of prey attacked the herd, over which he kept guard at night, he would seize it by one of its legs, and whirl it around until it was stunned, and then he would fling it away to a distance of two stadia, and kill it thus. Once Jacob sent Joseph to tend the flock, but he remained away only thirty days, for he was a delicate lad and fell sick with the heat, and he hastened back to his father. On his return he told Jacob that the sons of the handmaids were in the habit of slaughtering the choice cattle of the herd and eating it, without obtaining permission from Judah and Reuben. But his report was not accurate. What he had seen was Gad slaughtering one lamb, which he had snatched from the very jaws of a bear, and he killed it because it could not be kept alive after its fright. Joseph&apos;s account sounded as though the sons of the handmaids were habitually inconsiderate and careless in wasting their father&apos;s substance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">To the resentment of the brethren was added their envy of Joseph, because their father loved him more than all of them. Joseph&apos;s beauty of person was equal to that of his mother Rachel, and Jacob had but to look at him to be consoled for the death of his beloved wife. Reason enough for distinguishing him among his children. As a token of his great love for him, Jacob gave Joseph a coat of many colors, so light and delicate that it could be crushed and concealed in the closed palm of one hand. The Hebrew name of the garment, Passim, conveys the story of the sale of Joseph. The first letter, Pe, stands for Potiphar, his Egyptian master; Samek stands for Soharim, the merchantmen that bought Joseph from the company of Ishmaelites to whom his brethren had sold him; Yod stands for these same Ishmaelites; and Mem, for the Midianites that obtained him from the merchantmen, and then disposed of him to Potiphar. But Passim. has yet another meaning, &quot;clefts.&quot; His brethren knew that the Red Sea would be cleft in twain in days to come for Joseph&apos;s sake, and they were jealous of the glory to be conferred upon him. Although they were filled with hatred of him, it must be said in their favor that they were not of a sullen, spiteful nature. They did not hide their feelings, they proclaimed their enmity openly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">Once Joseph dreamed a dream, and he could not refrain from telling it to his brethren. He spoke, and said: &quot;Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed. Behold, you gathered fruit, and so did I. Your fruit rotted, but mine remained sound. Your seed will set up dumb images of idols, but they will vanish at the appearance of my descendant, the Messiah of Joseph. You will keep the truth as to my fate from the knowledge of my father, but I will stand fast as a reward for the self-denial of my mother, and you will prostrate yourselves five times before me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">The brethren refused at first to listen to the dream, but when Joseph urged them again and again, they gave heed to him, and they said, &quot;Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?&quot; God put an interpretation into their mouths that was to be verified in the posterity of Joseph. Jeroboam and Jehu, two kings, and Joshua and Gideon, two judges, have been among his descendants, corresponding to the double and emphatic expressions used by his brethren in interpreting the dream.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">Then Joseph dreamed another dream, how the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowed down before him, and Jacob, to whom he told it first, was rejoiced over it, for he understood its meaning properly. He knew that he himself was designated by the sun, the name by which God had called him when he lodged overnight on the holy site of the Temple. He had heard God say to the angels at that time, &quot;The sun has come.&quot; The moon stood for Joseph&apos;s mother, and the stars for his brethren, for the righteous are as the stars. Jacob was so convinced of the truth of the dream that he was encouraged to believe that he would live to see the resurrection of the dead, for Rachel was dead, and her return to earth was clearly indicated by the dream. He went astray there, for not Joseph&apos;s own mother was referred to, but his foster-mother Bilhah, who had raised him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">Jacob wrote the dream in a book, recording all the circumstances, the day, the hour, and the place, for the holy spirit cautioned him, &quot;Take heed, these things will surely come to pass.&quot; But when Joseph repeated his dream to his brethren, in the presence of his father, Jacob rebuked him, saying, &quot;I and thy brethren, that has some sense, but I and thy mother, that is inconceivable, for thy mother is dead.&quot; These words of Jacob called forth a reproof from God. He said, &quot;Thus thy descendants will in time to come seek to hinder Jeremiah in delivering his prophecies.&quot; Jacob may be excused, he had spoken in this way only in order to avert the envy and hate of his brethren from Joseph, but they envied and hated him because they knew that the interpretation put upon the dream by Jacob would be realized.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He had another dream which he told his brothers: “Here, I had another dream, and there were the sun, the moon and eleven stars prostrating themselves before me.” He told his father too, as well as his brothers, but his father rebuked him: “What is this dream you have had? Do you really expect me, your mother and your brothers to come and prostrate ourselves before you on the ground?” His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> After this, when his brothers had gone to pasture their father’s sheep in Sh’khem, Isra’el asked Yosef, “Aren’t your brothers pasturing the sheep in Sh’khem? Come, I will send you to them.” He answered, “Here I am.” He said to him, “Go now, see whether things are going well with your brothers and with the sheep, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him away from the Hevron Valley, and he went to Sh’khem, where a man found him wandering around in the countryside. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?” “I’m looking for my brothers,” he answered. “Tell me, please, where are they pasturing the sheep?” The man said, “They’ve left here; because I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dotan.’” Yosef went after his brothers and found them in Dotan.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They spotted him in the distance, and before he had arrived where they were, they had already plotted to kill him. They said to each other, “Look, this dreamer is coming! So come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these water cisterns here. Then we’ll say some wild animal devoured him. We’ll see then what becomes of his dreams!” But when Re’uven heard this, he saved him from being destroyed by them. He said, “We shouldn’t take his life. Don’t shed blood,” Re’uven added. “Throw him into this cistern here in the wilds, but don’t lay hands on him yourselves.” He intended to rescue him from them later and restore him to his father.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Once the brethren of Joseph led their father&apos;s flocks to the pastures of Shechem, and they intended to take their ease and pleasure there. They stayed away a long time, and no tidings of them were heard. Jacob began to be anxious about the fate of his sons. He feared that a war had broken out between them and the people of Shechem, and he resolved to send Joseph to them and have him bring word again, whether it was well with his brethren. Jacob desired to know also about the flocks, for it is a duty to concern oneself about the welfare of anything from which one derives profit. Though he knew that the hatred of his brethren might bring on unpleasant adventures, yet Joseph, in filial reverence, declared himself ready to go </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">on his father&apos;s errand. Later, whenever Jacob remembered his dear son&apos;s willing spirit, the recollection stabbed him to the heart. He would say to himself, &quot;Thou didst know the hatred of thy brethren, and yet thou didst say, Here am I.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob dismissed Joseph, with the injunction that he journey only by daylight, saying furthermore, &quot;Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and send me word&quot;--an unconscious prophecy. He did not say that he expected to see Joseph again, but only to have word from him. Since the covenant of the pieces, God had resolved, on account of Abraham&apos;s doubting question, that Jacob and his family should go down into Egypt to dwell there. The preference shown to Joseph by his father, and the envy it aroused, leading finally to the sale of Joseph and his establishment in Egypt, were but disguised means created by God, instead of executing His counsel directly by carrying Jacob down into Egypt as a captive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph reached Shechem, where he expected to find his brethren. Shechem was always a place of ill omen for Jacob and his seed--there Dinah was dishonored, there the Ten Tribes of Israel rebelled against the house of David while Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem, and there Jeroboam was installed as king. Not finding his brethren and the herd in Shechem, Joseph continued his journey in the direction of the next pasturing place, not far from Shechem, but he lost his way in the wilderness. Gabriel in human shape appeared before him, and asked him, saying, &quot;What seekest thou?&quot; And he answered, &quot;I seek my brethren.&quot; Whereto the angel replied, &quot;Thy brethren have given up the Divine qualities of love and mercy. Through a prophetic revelation they learned that the Hivites were preparing to make war upon them, and therefore they departed hence to go to Dothan. And they had to leave this place for other reasons, too. I heard, while I was still standing behind the curtain that veils the Divine throne, that this day the Egyptian bondage would begin, and thou wouldst be the first to be subjected to it.&quot; Then Gabriel led Joseph to Dothan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When his brethren saw him afar off, they conspired against him, to slay him. Their first plan was to set dogs on him. Simon then spoke to Levi, &quot;Behold, the master of dreams cometh with a new dream, he whose descendant Jeroboam will introduce the worship of Baal. Come now, therefore, and let us slay him, that we may see what </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">will become of his dreams.&quot; But God spoke: &quot;Ye say, We shall see what will become of his dreams, and I say likewise, We shall see, and the future shall show whose word will stand, yours or Mine.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Simon and Gad set about slaying Joseph, and he fell upon his face, and entreated them: &quot;Have mercy with me, my brethren, have pity on the heart of my father Jacob. Lay not your hands upon me, to spill innocent blood, for I have done no evil unto you. But if I have done evil unto you, then chastise me with a chastisement, but your hands lay not upon me, for the sake of our father Jacob.&quot; These words touched Zebulon, and he began to lament and weep, and the wailing of Joseph rose up together with his brother&apos;s, and when Simon and Gad raised their hands against him to execute their evil design, Joseph took refuge behind Zebulon, and supplicated his other brethren to have mercy upon him. Then Reuben arose, and he said, &quot;Brethren, let us not slay him, but let us cast him into one of the dry pits, which our fathers dug without finding water.&quot; That was due to the providence of God; He had hindered the water from rising in them in order that Joseph&apos;s rescue might be accomplished, and the pits remained dry until Joseph was safe in the hands of the Ishmaelites.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Reuben had several reasons for interceding in behalf of Joseph. He knew that he as the oldest of the brethren would be held responsible by their father, if any evil befell him. Besides, Reuben was grateful to Joseph for having reckoned him among the eleven sons of Jacob in narrating his dream of the sun, moon, and stars. Since his disrespectful bearing toward Jacob, he had not thought himself worthy of being considered one of his sons. First Reuben tried to restrain his brethren from their purpose, and he addressed them in words full of love and compassion. But when he saw that neither words nor entreaties would change their intention, he begged them, saying: &quot;My brethren, at least hearken unto me in respect of this, that ye be not so wicked and cruel as to slay him. Lay no hand upon your brother, shed no blood, cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and let him perish thus.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Reuben went away from his brethren, and he hid in the mountains, so that he might be able to hasten back in a favorable moment and draw Joseph forth from the pit and restore him to his father. He hoped his reward would be pardon for the transgression he had committed against Jacob. His good intention was frustrated, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">yet Reuben was rewarded by God, for God gives a recompense not only for good deeds, but for good intentions as well. As he was the first of the brethren of Joseph to make an attempt to save him, so the city of Bezer in the tribe of Reuben was the first of the cities of refuge appointed to safeguard the life of the innocent that seek help. Furthermore God spake to Reuben, saying: &quot;As thou wast the first to endeavor to restore a child unto his father, so Hosea, one of thy descendants, shall be the first to endeavor to lead Israel back to his heavenly Father.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The brethren accepted Reuben&apos;s proposition, and Simon seized Joseph, and cast him into a pit swarming with snakes and scorpions, beside which was another unused pit, filled with offal. As though this were not enough torture, Simon bade his brethren fling great stones at Joseph. In his later dealings with this brother Simon, Joseph showed all the forgiving charitableness of his nature. When Simon was held in durance in Egypt as a hostage, Joseph, so far from bearing him a grudge, ordered crammed poultry to be set before him at all his meals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not satisfied with exposing Joseph to the snakes and scorpions, his brethren had stripped him bare before they flung him into the pit. They took off his coat of many colors, his upper garment, his breeches, and his shirt. However, the reptiles could do him no harm. God heard his cry of distress, and kept them in hiding in the clefts and the holes, and they could not come near him. From the depths of the pit Joseph appealed to his brethren, saying: &quot;O my brethren, what have I done unto you, and what is my transgression? Why are you not afraid before God on account of your treatment of me? Am I not flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone? Jacob your father, is he not also my father? Why do you act thus toward me? And how will you be able to lift up your countenance before Jacob? O Judah, Reuben, Simon, Levi, my brethren, deliver me, I pray you, from the dark place into which you have cast me. Though I committed a trespass against you, yet are ye children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were compassionate with the orphan, gave food to the hungry, and clothed the naked. How, then, can ye withhold your pity from your own brother, your own flesh and bone? And though I sinned against you, yet you will hearken unto my petition for the sake of my father. O that my father knew what my brethren are doing unto me, and what they spake unto me!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>To avoid hearing Joseph&apos;s weeping and cries of distress, his brethren passed on from the pit, and stood at a bow-shot&apos;s distance. The only one among them that manifested pity was Zebulon. For two days and two nights no food passed his lips on account of his grief over the fate of Joseph, who had to spend three days and three nights in the pit before he was sold. During this period Zebulon was charged by his brethren to keep watch at the pit. He was chosen to stand guard because he took no part in the meals. Part of the time Judah also refrained from eating with the rest, and took turns at watching, because he feared Simon and Gad might jump down into the pit and put an end to Joseph&apos;s life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While Joseph was languishing thus, his brethren determined to kill him. They would finish their meal first, they said, and then they would fetch him forth and slay him. When they had done eating, they attempted to say grace, but Judah remonstrated with them: &quot;We are about to take the life of a human being, and yet would bless God? That is not a blessing, that is contemning the Lord. What profit is it if we slay our brother? Rather will the punishment of God descend upon us. I have good counsel to give you. Yonder passeth by a travelling company of Ishmaelites on their way to Egypt. Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him. The Ishmaelites will take him with them upon their journeyings, and he will be lost among the peoples of the earth. Let us follow the custom of former days, for Canaan, too, the son of Ham, was made a slave for his evil deeds, and so will we do with our brother Joseph.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then they sat down to eat their meal; but as they looked up, they saw in front of them a caravan of Yishma‘elim coming from Gil‘ad, their camels loaded with aromatic gum, healing resin and opium, on their way down to Egypt. Y’hudah said to his brothers, “What advantage is it to us if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come, let’s sell him to the Yishma‘elim, instead of putting him to death with our own hands. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers paid attention to him. So when the Midyanim, merchants, passed by, they drew and lifted Yosef up out of the cistern and sold him for half a pound of silver </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">shekel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">s to the Yishma‘elim, who took Yosef on to Egypt.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While the brethren of Joseph were deliberating upon his fate, seven Midianitish merchantmen passed near the pit in which he lay. They noticed that many birds were circling above it, whence they assumed that there must be water therein, and, being thirsty, they made a halt in order to refresh themselves. When they came close, they heard Joseph screaming and wailing, and they looked down into the pit and saw a youth of beautiful figure and comely appearance. They called to him, saying: &quot;Who art thou? Who brought thee hither, and who cast thee into this pit in the wilderness?&quot; They all joined together and dragged him up, and took him along with them when they continued on their journey. They had to pass his brethren, who called out to the Midianites: &quot;Why have you done such a thing, to steal our slave and carry him away with you? We threw the lad into the pit, because he was disobedient. Now, then, return our slave to us.&quot; The Midianites replied: &quot;What, this lad, you say, is your slave, your servant? More likely is it that you all are slaves unto him, for in beauty of form, in pleasant looks, and fair appearance, he excelleth you all. Why, then, will you speak lies unto us? We will not give ear unto your words, nor believe you, for we found the lad in the wilderness, in a pit, and we took him out, and we will carry him away with us on our journey.&quot; But the sons of Jacob insisted, &quot;Restore our slave to us, lest you meet death at the edge of the sword.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Unaffrighted, the Midianites drew their weapons, and, amid war whoops, they prepared to enter into a combat with the sons of Jacob. Then Simon rose up, and with bared sword he sprang upon the Midianites, at the same time uttering a cry that made the earth reverberate. The Midianites fell down in great consternation, and he said: &quot;I am Simon, the son of the Hebrew Jacob, who destroyed the city of Shechem alone and unaided, and together with my brethren I destroyed the cities of the Amorites. God do so and more also, if it be not true that all the Midianites, your brethren, united with all the Canaanite kings to fight with me, cannot hold out against me. Now restore the boy you took from us, else will I give your flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Midianites were greatly afraid of Simon, and, terrified and abashed, they spake to the sons of Jacob with little courage: &quot;Said ye not that ye cast this lad into the pit </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">because he was of a rebellious spirit? What, now, will ye do with an insubordinate slave? Rather sell him to us, we are ready to pay any price you desire.&quot; This speech was part of the purpose of God. He had put it into the heart of the Midianites to insist upon possessing Joseph, that he might not remain with his brethren, and be slain by them. The brethren assented, and Joseph was sold as a slave while they sat over their meal. God spake, saying: &quot;Over a meal did ye sell your brother, and thus shall Ahasuerus sell your descendants to Haman over a meal, and because ye have sold Joseph to be a slave, therefore shall ye say year after year, Slaves were we unto Pharaoh in Egypt.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The price paid for Joseph by the Midianites was twenty pieces of silver, enough for a pair of shoes for each of his brethren. Thus &quot;they sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.&quot; For so handsome a youth as Joseph the sum paid was too low by far, but his appearance had been greatly changed by the horrible anguish he had endured in the pit with the snakes and the scorpions. He had lost his ruddy complexion, and he looked sallow and sickly, and the Midianites were justified in paying a small sum for him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The merchantmen had come upon Joseph naked in the pit, for his brethren had stripped him of all his clothes. That he might not appear before men in an unseemly condition, God sent Gabriel down to him, and the angel enlarged the amulet banging from Joseph&apos;s neck until it was a garment that covered him entirely. Joseph&apos;s brethren were looking after him as he departed with the Midianites, and when they saw him with clothes upon him, they cried after them, &quot;Give us his raiment! We sold him naked, without clothes.&quot; His owners refused to yield to their demand, but they agreed to reimburse the brethren with four pairs of shoes, and Joseph kept his garment, the same in which he was arrayed when he arrived in Egypt and was sold to Potiphar, the same in which he was locked up in prison and appeared before Pharaoh, and the same he wore when he was ruler over Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As an atonement for the twenty pieces of silver taken by his brethren in exchange for Joseph, God commanded that every first-born son shall be redeemed by the priest with an equal amount, and, also, every Israelite must pay annually to the sanctuary as much as fell to each of the brethren as his share of the price.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The brethren of Joseph bought shoes for the money, for they said: &quot;We will not eat it, because it is the price for the blood of our brother, but we will tread upon him, for that he spake, he would have dominion over us, and we will see what will become of his dreams.&quot; And for this reason the ordinance has been commanded, that he who refuseth to raise up a name in Israel unto his brother that hath died without having a son, shall have his shoe loosed from off his foot, and his face shall be spat upon. Joseph&apos;s brethren refused to do aught to preserve his life, and therefore the Lord loosed their shoes from off their feet, for, when they went down to Egypt, the slaves of Joseph took their shoes off their feet as they entered the gates, and they prostrated themselves before Joseph as before a Pharaoh, and, as they lay prostrate, they were spat upon, and put to shame before the Egyptians.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Midianites pursued their journey to Gilead, but they soon regretted the purchase they had made. They feared that Joseph had been stolen in the land of the Hebrews, though sold to them as a slave, and if his kinsmen should find him with them, death would be inflicted upon them for the abduction of a free man. The high-handed manner of the sons of Jacob confirmed their suspicion, that they might be capable of man theft. Their wicked deed would explain, too, why they had accepted so small a sum in exchange for Joseph. While discussing these points, they saw, coming their way, the travelling company of Ishmaelites that had been observed earlier by the sons of Jacob, and they determined to dispose of Joseph to them, that they might at least not lose the price they had paid, and might escape the danger at the same time of being made captives for the crime of kidnapping a man. And the Ishmaelites bought Joseph from the Midianites, and they paid the same price as his former owners had given for him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As a rule the only merchandise with which the Ishmaelites loaded their camels was pitch and the skins of beasts. By a providential dispensation they carried bags of perfumery this time, instead of their usual ill-smelling freight, that sweet fragrance might be wafted to Joseph on his journey to Egypt. These aromatic substances were well suited to Joseph, whose body emitted a pleasant smell, so agreeable and pervasive that the road along which he travelled was redolent thereof, and on his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">arrival in Egypt the perfume from his body spread over the whole land, and the royal princesses, following the sweet scent to trace its source, reached the place in which Joseph was. Even after his death the same fragrance was spread abroad by his bones, enabling Moses to distinguish Joseph&apos;s remains from all others, and keep the oath of the children of Israel, to inter them in the Holy Land.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Joseph learned that the Ishmaelites were carrying him to Egypt, he began to weep bitterly at the thought of being removed so far from Canaan and from his father. One of the Ishmaelites noticed Joseph&apos;s weeping and crying, and thinking that he found riding uncomfortable, he lifted him from the back of the camel, and permitted him to walk on foot. But Joseph continued to weep and sob, crying incessantly, &quot;O father, father!&quot; Another one of the caravan, tired of his lamentations, beat him, causing only the more tears and wails, until the youth, exhausted by his grief, was unable to move on. Now all the Ishmaelites in the company dealt out blows to him. They treated him with relentless cruelty, and tried to silence him by threats. God saw Joseph&apos;s distress, and He sent darkness and terror upon the Ishmaelites, and their hands grew rigid when they raised them to inflict a blow. Astonished, they asked themselves why God did thus unto them upon the road. They did not know that it was for the sake of Joseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The journey was continued until they came to Ephrath, the place of Rachel&apos;s sepulchre. Joseph hastened to his mother&apos;s grave, and throwing himself across it, he groaned and cried, saying: &quot;O mother, mother, that didst bear me, arise, come forth and see how thy son hath been sold into slavery, with none to take pity upon him. Arise, see thy son, and weep with me over my misfortune, and observe the heartlessness of my brethren. Awake, O mother, rouse thyself from thy sleep, rise up and prepare for the conflict with my brethren, who stripped me even of my shirt, and sold me as a slave to merchantmen, who in turn sold me to others, and without mercy they tore me away from my father. Arise, accuse my brethren before God, and see whom He will justify in the judgment, and whom He will find guilty. Arise, O mother, awake from thy sleep, see how my father is with me in his soul and in his spirit, and comfort him and ease his heavy heart.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Joseph wept and cried upon the grave of his mother, until, weary from grief, he lay immovable as a stone. Then he heard a voice heavy with tears speak to him from the depths, saying: &quot;My son Joseph, my son, I heard thy complaints and thy groans, I saw thy tears, and I knew thy misery, my son. I am grieved for thy sake, and thy affliction is added to the burden of my affliction. But, my son Joseph, put thy trust in God, and wait upon Him. Fear not, for the Lord is with thee, and He will deliver thee from all evil. Go down into Egypt with thy masters, my son; fear naught, for the Lord is with thee, O my son.&quot; This and much more like unto it did the voice utter, and then it was silent. Joseph listened in great amazement at first, and then he broke out in renewed tears. Angered thereby, one of the Ishmaelites drove him from his mother&apos;s grave with kicks and curses. Then Joseph entreated his masters to take him back to his father, who would give them great riches as a reward. But they said, &quot;Why, thou art a slave! How canst thou know where thy father is? If thou hadst had a free man as father, thou wouldst not have been sold twice for a petty sum.&quot; And then their fury against him increased, they beat him and maltreated him, and he wept bitter tears.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now God looked upon the distress of Joseph, and He sent darkness to enshroud the land once more. A storm raged, the lightning flashed, and from the thunderbolts the whole earth trembled, and the Ishmaelites lost their way in their terror. The beasts and the camels stood still, and, beat them as their drivers would, they refused to budge from the spot, but crouched down upon the ground. Then the Ishmaelites spake to one another, and said: &quot;Why hath God brought this upon us? What are our sins, what our trespasses, that such things befall us?&quot; One of them said to the others: &quot;Peradventure this hath come upon us by reason of the sin which we have committed against this slave. Let us beg him earnestly to grant us forgiveness, and if then God will take pity, and let these storms pass away from us, we shall know that we suffered harm on account of the injury we inflicted upon this slave.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Ishmaelites did according to these words, and they said unto Joseph: &quot;We have sinned against God and against thee. Pray to thy God, and entreat Him to take this death plague from us, for we acknowledge that we have sinned against Him.&quot; Joseph fulfilled their wish, and God hearkened to his petition, and the storm was assuaged. All around became calm, the beasts arose from their recumbent position, and the caravan could proceed upon its way. Now the Ishmaelites saw plainly that all their </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">trouble had come upon them for the sake of Joseph, and they spoke one to another, saying: &quot;We know now that all this evil hath happened to us on account of this poor fellow, and wherefore should we bring death upon ourselves by our own doings? Let us take counsel together, what is to be done with the slave.&quot; One of them advised that Joseph&apos;s wish be fulfilled, and he be taken back to his father. Then they would be sure of receiving the money they had paid out for him. This plan was rejected, because they had accomplished a great part of their journey, and they were not inclined to retrace their steps. They therefore resolved upon carrying Joseph to Egypt and selling him there. They would rid themselves of him in this way, and also receive a great price for him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They continued their journey as far as the borders of Egypt, and there they met four men, descendants of Medan, the son of Abraham, and to these they sold Joseph for five shekels. The two companies, the Ishmaelites and the Medanites, arrived in Egypt upon the same day. The latter, hearing that Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, was seeking a good slave, repaired to him at once, to try to dispose of Joseph to him. Potiphar was willing to pay as much as four hundred pieces of silver, for, high as the price was, it did not seem too great for a slave that pleased him as much as Joseph. However, he made a condition. He said to the Medanites: &quot;I will pay you the price demanded, but you must bring me the person that sold the slave to you, that I may be in a position to find out all about him, for the youth seems to me to be neither a slave nor the son of a slave. He appears to be of noble blood. I must convince myself that he was not stolen.&quot; The Medanites brought the Ishmaelites to Potiphar, and they testified that Joseph was a slave, that they had owned him, and had sold him to the Medanites. Potiphar rested satisfied with this report, paid the price asked for Joseph, and the Medanites and the Ishmaelites went their way.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Re’uven returned to the cistern, and, upon seeing that Yosef wasn’t in it, tore his clothes in mourning. He returned to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I go now?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>They took Yosef’s robe, killed a male goat and dipped the robe in the blood. Then they sent the long-sleeved robe and brought it to their father, saying, “We found this. Do you know if it’s your son’s robe or not?” He recognized it and cried, “It’s my son’s robe! Some wild animal has torn Yosef in pieces and eaten him!” Ya‘akov tore his clothes and, putting sackcloth around his waist, mourned his son for many days. Though all his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, he refused all consolation, saying, “No, I will go down to the grave, to my son, mourning.” And his father wept for him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">No sooner was the sale of Joseph an accomplished fact than the sons of Jacob repented of their deed. They even hastened after the Midianites to ransom Joseph, but their efforts to overtake them were vain, and they had to accept the inevitable. Meantime Reuben had rejoined his brethren. He had been so deeply absorbed in penances, in praying and studying the Torah, in expiation of his sin against his father, that he had not been able to remain with his brethren and tend the flocks, and thus it happened that he was not on the spot when Joseph was sold. His first errand was to go to the pit, in the hope of finding Joseph there. In that case he would have carried him off and restored him to his father clandestinely, without the knowledge of his brethren. He stood at the opening and called again and again, &quot;Joseph, Joseph!&quot; As he received no answer, he concluded that Joseph had perished, either by reason of terror or as the result of a snake bite, and he descended into the pit, only to find that he was not there, either living or dead. He mounted to the top again, and rent his clothes, and cried out, &quot;The lad is not there, and what answer shall I give to my father, if he be dead?&quot; Then Reuben returned unto his brethren, and told them that Joseph had vanished from the pit, whereat he was deeply grieved, because he, being the oldest of the sons, was responsible to their father Jacob. The brethren made a clean breast of what they had done with Joseph, and they related to him how they had tried to make good their evil deed, and how their efforts had been vain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now there remained nothing to do but invent a plausible explanation for their brother&apos;s disappearance to give to Jacob. First of all, however, they took an oath not to betray to his father or any human being what they had actually done with Joseph. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">He who violated the oath would be put to the sword by the rest. Then they took counsel together about what to say to Jacob. It was Issachar&apos;s advice to tear Joseph&apos;s coat of many colors, and dip it in the blood of a little kid of the goats, to make Jacob believe that his son had been torn by a wild beast. The reason he suggested a kid was because its blood looks like human blood. In expiation of this act of deception, it was ordained that a kid be used as an atonement sacrifice when the Tabernacle was dedicated.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Simon opposed this suggestion. He did not want to relinquish Joseph&apos;s coat, and he threatened to hew down any one that should attempt to wrest it from him by force. The reason for his vehemence was that he was very much enraged against his brethren for not having slain Joseph. But they threatened him in turn, saying, &quot;If thou wilt not give up the coat, we shall say that thou didst execute the evil deed thyself.&quot; At that Simon surrendered it, and Naphtali brought it to Jacob, handing it to him with the words: &quot;When we were driving our herds homeward, we found this garment covered with blood and dust on the highway, a little beyond Shechem. Know now whether it be thy son&apos;s coat or not.&quot; Jacob recognized Joseph&apos;s coat, and, overwhelmed by grief, he fell prostrate, and long lay on the ground motionless, like a stone. Then he arose, and set up a loud cry, and wept, saying, &quot;It is my son&apos;s coat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In great haste Jacob dispatched a slave to his sons, to bid them come to him, that he might learn more about what had happened. In the evening they all came, their garments rent, and dust strewn upon their heads. When they confirmed all that Naphtali had told him, Jacob broke out in mourning and lamentation: &quot;It is my son&apos;s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. I sent him to you to see whether it was well with you, and well with the flock. He went to do my errand, and while I thought him to be with you, the misfortune befell.&quot; Thereto the sons of Jacob made reply: &quot;He came to us not at all. Since we left thee, we have not set eyes on him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After these words, Jacob could doubt no longer that Joseph had been torn by wild beasts, and he mourned for his son, saying: &quot;O my son Joseph, my son, I sent thee to inquire after the welfare of thy brethren, and now thou art torn by wild beasts. It is my </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">fault that this evil chance hath come upon thee. I am distressed for thee, my son, I am sorely distressed. How sweet was thy life to me, and how bitter is thy death! Would God I had died for thee, O Joseph, my son, for now I am distressed on thy account. O my son Joseph, where art thou, and where is thy soul? Arise, arise from thy place, and look upon my grief for thee. Come and count the tears that roll down my cheeks, and bring the tale of them before God, that His wrath be turned away from me. O Joseph, my son, how painful and appalling was thy death! None hath died a death like thine since the world doth stand. I know well that it came to pass by reason of my sins. O that thou wouldst return and see the bitter sorrow thy misfortune hath brought upon me! But it is true, it was not I that created thee, and formed thee. I gave thee neither spirit nor soul, but God created thee. He formed thy bones, covered them with flesh, breathed the breath of life into thy nostrils, and then gave thee unto me. And God who gave thee unto me, He hath taken thee from me, and from Him hath this dispensation come upon me. What the Lord doeth is well done!&quot; In these words and many others like them Jacob mourned and bewailed his son, until he fell to the ground prostrate and immovable.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the sons of Jacob saw the vehemence of their father&apos;s grief, they repented of their deed, and wept bitterly. Especially Judah was grief-stricken. He laid his father&apos;s head upon his knees, and wiped his tears away as they flowed from his eyes, while he himself broke out in violent weeping. The sons of Jacob and their wives all sought to comfort their father. They arranged a great memorial service, and they wept and mourned over Joseph&apos;s death and over their father&apos;s sorrow. But Jacob refused to be comforted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The tidings of his son&apos;s death caused the loss of two members of Jacob&apos;s family. Bilhah and Dinah could not survive their grief. Bilhah passed away the very day whereon the report reached Jacob, and Dinah died soon after, and so he had three losses to mourn in one month.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">He received the tidings of Joseph&apos;s death in the seventh month, Tishri, and on the tenth day of the month, and therefore the children of Israel are bidden to weep and afflict their souls on this day. Furthermore, on this day the sin offering of atonement </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">shall be a kid of the goats, because the sons of Jacob transgressed with a kid, in the blood of which they dipped Joseph&apos;s coat, and thus they brought sorrow upon Jacob.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When he had recovered somewhat from the stunning blow which the tidings of his favorite son&apos;s death had dealt him, Jacob rose up from the ground and addressed his sons, tears streaming down his cheeks all the while. &quot;Up,&quot; he said, &quot;take your swords and your bows, go out in the field, and make search, perhaps you will find the body of my son, and you will bring it to me, so that I may bury it. Keep a lookout, too, for beasts of prey, and catch the first you meet. Seize it and bring it to me. It may be that God will have pity upon my sorrow, and put the beast between your hands that hath torn my child in pieces, and I will take my revenge upon it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sons of Jacob set out on the morrow to do the bidding of their father, while he remained at home and wept and lamented for Joseph. In the wilderness they found a wolf, which they caught and brought to Jacob alive, saying: &quot;Here is the first wild beast we encountered, and we have brought it to thee. But of thy son&apos;s corpse we saw not a trace.&quot; Jacob seized the wolf, and, amid loud weeping, he addressed these words to him: &quot;Why didst thou devour my son Joseph, without any fear of the God of the earth, and without taking any thought of the grief thou wouldst bring down upon me? Thou didst devour my son without reason, he was guilty of no manner of transgression, and thou didst roll the responsibility for his death upon me. But God avengeth him that is persecuted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">To grant consolation to Jacob, God opened the mouth of the beast, and he spake: &quot;As the Lord liveth, who hath created me, and as thy soul liveth, my lord, I have not seen thy son, and I did not rend him in pieces. From a land afar off I came to seek mine own son, who suffered a like fate with thine. He hath disappeared, and I know not whether he be dead or alive, and therefore I came hither ten days ago to find him. This day, while I was searching for him, thy sons met me, and they seized me, and, adding more grief to my grief over my lost son, they brought me hither to thee. This is my story, and now, O son of man, I am in thy hands, thou canst dispose of me this day as seemeth well in thy sight, but I swear unto thee by the God that bath created me, I have not seen thy son, nor have I torn him in pieces, never hath the flesh of man </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">come into my mouth.&quot; Astonished at the speech of the wolf, Jacob let him go, unhindered, whithersoever he would, but he mourned his son Joseph as before.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It is a law of nature that however much one may grieve over the death of a dear one, at the end of a year consolation finds its way to the heart of the mourner. But the disappearance of a living man can never be wiped out of one&apos;s memory. Therefore the fact that he was inconsolable made Jacob suspect that Joseph was alive, and he did not give entire credence to the report of his sons. His vague suspicion was strengthened by something that happened to him. He went up into the mountains, hewed twelve stones out of the quarry, and wrote the names of his sons thereon, their constellations, and the months corresponding to the constellations, a stone for a son, thus, &quot;Reuben, Ram, Nisan,&quot; and so for each of his twelve sons. Then he addressed the stones and bade them bow down before the one marked with Reuben&apos;s name, constellation, and month, and they did not move. He gave the same order regarding the stone marked for Simon, and again the stones stood still. And so he did respecting all his sons, until he reached the stone for Joseph. When he spoke concerning this one, &quot;I command you to fall down before Joseph,&quot; they all prostrated themselves. He tried the same test with other things, with trees and sheaves, and always the result was the same, and Jacob could not but feel that his suspicion was true, Joseph was alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">There was a reason why God did not reveal the real fate of Joseph to Jacob. When his brethren sold Joseph, their fear that the report of their iniquity might reach the ears of Jacob led them to pronounce the ban upon any that should betray the truth without the consent of all the others. Judah advanced the objection that a ban is invalid unless it is decreed in the presence of ten persons, and there were but nine of them, for Reuben and Benjamin were not there when the sale of Joseph was concluded. To evade the difficulty, the brothers counted God as the tenth person, and therefore God felt bound to refrain from revealing the true state of things to Jacob. He had regard, as it were, for the ban pronounced by the brethren of Joseph. And as God kept the truth a secret from Jacob, Isaac did not feel justified in acquainting him with his grandson&apos;s fate, which was well known to him, for he was a prophet. Whenever he was in the company of Jacob, he mourned with him, but as soon as he quitted him, he left off from manifesting grief, because he knew that Joseph lived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Jacob was thus the only one among Joseph&apos;s closest kinsmen that remained in ignorance of his son&apos;s real fortunes, and he was the one of them all that had the greatest reason for regretting his death. He spoke: &quot;The covenant that God made with me regarding the twelve tribes is null and void now. I did strive in vain to establish the twelve tribes, seeing that now the death of Joseph hath destroyed the covenant. All the works of God were made to correspond to the number of the tribes--twelve are the signs of the zodiac, twelve the months, twelve hours hath the day, twelve the night, and twelve stones are set in Aaron&apos;s breastplate--and now that Joseph hath departed, the covenant of the tribes is set at naught.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He could not replace the lost son by entering into a new marriage, for he had made the promise to his father-in-law to take none beside his daughters to wife, and this promise, as he interpreted it, held good after the death of Laban&apos;s daughters as well as while they were alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Beside grief over his loss and regret at the breaking of the covenant of the tribes, Jacob had still another reason for mourning the death of Joseph. God had said to Jacob, &quot;If none of thy sons dies during thy lifetime, thou mayest look upon it as a token that thou wilt not be put in Gehenna after thy death.&quot; Thinking Joseph to be dead, Jacob had his own fate to bewail, too, for he now believed that he was doomed to Gehenna. His mourning lasted all of twenty-two years, corresponding to the number of the years he had dwelt apart from his parents, and had not fulfilled the duty of a son toward them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In his mourning Jacob put sackcloth upon his loins, and therein be became a model for the kings and princes in Israel, for David, Ahab, Joram, and Mordecai did likewise when a great misfortune befell the nation.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P28">It was at this time that Y’hudah went off from his brothers and settled near a man named Hirah who was an ‘Adulami. There Y’hudah saw one of the daughters of a certain Kena‘ani whose name was Shua, and he took her and slept with her. She conceived and had a son, whom he named ‘Er. She conceived again and had a son, and she called him Onan. Then she conceived yet again and had a son whom she called Shelah; he was in K’ziv when she gave birth to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Y’hudah took a wife for ‘Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But ‘Er, Y’hudah’s firstborn, was evil from </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">’s perspective, so </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> killed him. Y’hudah said to Onan, “Go and sleep with your brother’s wife — perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and preserve your brother’s line of descent.” However, Onan knew that the child would not count as his; so whenever he had intercourse with his brother’s wife, he spilled the semen on the ground, so as not to give his brother offspring. What he did was evil from </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">’s perspective, so he killed him too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Y’hudah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Stay a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”; for he thought, “I don’t want him to die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went and lived at home with her father. In due time, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Y’hudah, died. After Y’hudah had been comforted, he went up to be with his sheep-shearers in Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the ‘Adulami. Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law has gone up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” So she took off her widow’s clothes, completely covered her face with her veil, and sat at the entrance to ‘Einayim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah had grown up, but she still was not being given to him as his wife. When Y’hudah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face. So he went over to her where she was sitting and said, not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, “Come, let me sleep with you.” She answered, “What will you pay to sleep with me?” He said, “I will send you a kid from the flock of goats.” She said, “Will you also give me something as a guarantee until you send it” He answered, “What should I give you as a guarantee?” She said, “Your seal, with its cord, and the staff you’re carrying in your hand.” So he gave them to her, then went and slept with her; and she </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">conceived by him. She got up and went away, took off her veil and put on her widow’s clothes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Y’hudah sent the kid with his friend the ‘Adulami to receive the guarantee items back from the woman, but he couldn’t find her. He asked the people near where she had been, “Where is the prostitute who was on the road at ‘Einayim?” But they answered, “There hasn’t been any prostitute here.” So he returned to Y’hudah and said, “I couldn’t find her; also the people there said, ‘There hasn’t been any prostitute here.’” Y’hudah said, “All right, let her keep the things, so that we won’t be publicly shamed. I sent the kid, but you didn’t find her.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">About three months later Y’hudah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has been acting like a whore; moreover, she is pregnant as a result of her prostitution.” Y’hudah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned alive!” When she was brought out, she sent this message to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these things belong. Determine, I beg you, whose these are — the signet, the cords and the staff.” Then Y’hudah acknowledged owning them. He said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t let her become the wife of my son Shelah.” And he never slept with her again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">When she went into labor, it became evident that she was going to have twins. As she was in labor, one of them put out his hand; and the midwife took his hand and tied a scarlet thread on it, saying, “This one came out first.” But then he withdrew his hand, and his brother came out; so she said, “How did you manage to break out first?” Therefore he was named Peretz [breaking out]. Then out came his brother, with the scarlet thread on his hand, and he was given the name Zerach [scarlet].</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the sons of Jacob saw how inconsolable their father was, they went to Judah, and said to him, &quot;This great misfortune is thy fault.&quot; Judah replied: &quot;It was I that asked you, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? and now you say the sin lies at my door.&quot; The brethren continued to argue: &quot;But it was thou that </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">didst say, Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and we followed thy advice. Hadst thou said, Let us restore him to his father, we had heeded these words of thine as well.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">The brethren hereupon deprived Judah of his dignity, for hitherto he had been their king, and they also excluded him from their fellowship, and he had to seek his fortune alone. Through the mediation of his chief shepherd Hirah, he became acquainted with the Canaanitish king of Adullam, Barsan by name. Though he was well aware of the corruption of the generations of Canaan, he permitted passion to get the better of him, and took a Canaanite to wife. The Adullamite king gave a banquet in his honor, at which his daughter Bath-shua poured the wine, and intoxicated by wine and passion Judah took her and married her. Judah&apos;s action may be compared to that of the lion who passes a carrion and eats of it, though a cur preceding him on the way had refused to touch it. Even Esau came in time to acknowledge that the daughters of Canaan were wicked, and the lion Judah must needs take one of them to wife. The holy spirit cried out against Judah when he married the Canaanite woman of Adullam, saying, &quot;The glory of Israel went down in Adullam.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The first-born son of Judah from this marriage was named Er, &quot;the childless,&quot; a suitable name for him that died without begetting any issue. At Judah&apos;s desire, Er married Tamar, a daughter of Aram, the son of Shem, but because she was not a Canaanitish woman, his mother used artifices against her, and he did not know her, and an angel of the Lord killed him on the third day after his wedding. Then Judah gave Tamar to his second son Onan, the marriage taking place before the week of the wedding festivities for Er had elapsed. A whole year Onan lived with Tamar without knowing her, and when, finally, Judah uttered threats against him on that account, he did, indeed, have intercourse with her, but, giving heed to the injunctions of his mother, he took care not to beget any children with her. He, too, died on account of his iniquity, and his name Onan &quot;mourning,&quot; was well chosen, for very soon was his father called upon to mourn for him. Now Judah conceived the plan of marrying Tamar to his youngest son Shelah, but his wife would not permit it. She hated Tamar because she was not of the daughters of Canaan like herself, and while </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Judah was away from home, Bath-shua chose a wife for her son Shelah from the daughters of Canaan. Judah was very angry at Bath-shua for what she had done, and also God poured out His wrath upon her, for on account of her wickedness she had to die, and her death happened a year after that of her two sons.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Now that Bath-shua was dead, Judah might have carried out his wish and married Tamar to his youngest son. But he waited for Shelah to grow up, because he feared for his life, seeing that Tamar had brought death to two husbands before him. So she remained a widow in her father&apos;s house for two years. Endowed with the gift of prophecy, Tamar knew that she was appointed to be the ancestress of David and of the Messiah, and she determined to venture upon an extreme measure in order to make sure of fulfilling her destiny. Accordingly, when the holy spirit revealed to her that Judah was going up to Timnah, she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and sat in the gate of Abraham&apos;s tent, and there she encountered Judah. All the time she lived in the house of her father-in-law, he had never seen her face, for in her virtue and chastity she had always kept it covered, and now when Judah met her, he did not recognize her. It was as a reward for her modesty that God made her to become the mother of the royal line of David, and the ancestress of Isaiah, and his father Amoz as well, both of whom were prophets and of royal blood.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Judah passed Tamar by without paying any attention to her, and she raised her eyes heavenward, and said, &quot;O Lord of the world, shall I go forth empty from the house of this pious man?&quot; Then God sent the angel that is appointed over the passion of love, and he compelled Judah to turn back. With prophetic caution, Tamar demanded that, as a pledge for the reward he promised her, he leave with her his signet, his mantle, and his staff, the symbols of royalty, judgeship, and Messiahship, the three distinctions of the descendants of Tamar from her union with Judah. When Judah sent her the promised reward, a kid of the goats, by the hand of his friend, in order to receive the pledges from her hand, Tamar could not be found, and he feared to make further search for her, lest he be put to shame. But Tamar, who soon discerned that she was with child, felt very happy and proud, for she knew that she would be the mother of kings and redeemers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:soft-page-break/>When her state became known, she was forcibly dragged before the court, in which Isaac, Jacob, and Judah sat as judges. Judah, being the youngest of the judges and the least considerable in dignity, was the first to give a decision, for thus it is prescribed in criminal cases, that the prominent judges overawe not the lesser and influence their decisions unduly. It was the opinion of Judah that the woman was liable to the penalty of death by burning, for she was the daughter of the high priest Shem, and death by fire is the punishment ordained by the law for a high priest&apos;s daughter that leads an unchaste life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The preparations for her execution were begun. In vain Tamar searched for the three pledges she had received from Judah, she could not find them, and almost she lost hope that she would be able to wring a confession from her father-in-law. She raised her eyes to God, and prayed: &quot;I supplicate Thy grace, O God, Thou who givest ear to the cry of the distressed in the hour of his need, answer me, that I may be spared to bring forth the three holy children, who will be ready to suffer death by fire, for the sake of the glory of Thy Name.&quot; And God granted her petition, and sent the angel Michael down to succor her. He put the pledges in a place in which Tamar could not fail to see them, and she took them, and threw them before the feet of the judges, with the words: &quot;By the man whose these are am I with child, but though I perish in the flames, I will not betray him. I hope in the Lord of the world, that He will turn the heart of the man, so that he will make confession thereof.&quot; Then Judah rose up, and said: &quot;With your permission, my brethren, and ye men of my father&apos;s house, I make it known that with what measure a man metes, it shall be measured unto him, be it for good or for evil, but happy the man that acknowledgeth his sins. Because I took the coat of Joseph, and colored it with the blood of a kid, and then laid it at the feet of my father, saying, Know now whether it be thy son&apos;s coat or not, therefore must I now confess, before the court, unto whom belongeth this signet, this mantle, and this staff. But it is better that I be put to shame in this world than I should be put to shame in the other world, before the face of my pious father. It is better that I should perish in a fire that can be extinguished than I should be cast into hell fire, which devoureth other fires. Now, then, I acknowledge that Tamar is innocent. By me is she with child, not because she indulged in illicit passion, but because I held back her </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">marriage with my son Shelah.&quot; Then a heavenly voice was heard to say: &quot;Ye are both innocent! It was the will of God that it should happen!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">The open confession of Judah induced his oldest brother Reuben to make public acknowledgment of the sin he had committed against his father, for he had kept it a secret until then.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Tamar gave birth to twin sons, Perez and Zerah, both resembling their father in bravery and piety. She called the first Perez, &quot;mighty,&quot; because she said, &quot;Thou didst show thyself of great power, and it is meet and proper that thou shouldst be strong, for thou art destined to possess the kingdom.&quot; The second son was called Zerah, because he appeared from out of the womb before his brother, but he was forced back again to make way for Perez. These two, Perez and Zerah. were sent out as spies by Joshua, and the line that Rahab bound in the window of her house as a token to the army of the Israelites, she received from Zerah. It was the scarlet thread that the midwife had bound upon his hand, to mark him as the child that appeared first and withdrew.</text:p>

After the sale of Joseph to the Midianites, his brethren had said to Judah, &quot;If conditions were as before, our father would provide wives for us now. As it is, he is entirely absorbed by his grief for Joseph, and we must look about for wives ourselves. Thou art our chief, and thou shouldst marry first.&quot;</text:p>

His two oldest sons died, and shortly thereafter his wife also. It was Judah&apos;s punishment for having begun a good deed and left it unfinished, for &quot;he who begins a good deed, and does not execute it to the end, brings down misfortune upon his own head.&quot; Judah had rescued Joseph from death, but it was his suggestion to sell him into slavery. Had he urged them to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">restore the lad to his father, his brethren would have obeyed his words. He was lacking in constancy to persist until he had completed the work of Joseph&apos;s deliverance, which he had begun.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">In the same year, the year of Joseph&apos;s misfortune, all his other brethren married, too. Reuben&apos;s wife was named Elyoram, the daughter of the Canaanite Uzzi of Timnah. Simon married his sister Dinah first, and then a second wife. When Simon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem, Dinah refused to leave the city and follow her brethren, saying, &quot;Whither shall I carry my shame?&quot; But Simon swore he would marry her, as he did later, and when she died in Egypt, he took her body to the Holy Land and buried it there. Dinah bore her brother a son, and from her union with Shechem, the son of Hamor, sprang a daughter, Asenath by name, afterward the wife of Joseph. When this daughter was born to Dinah, her brethren, the sons of Jacob, wanted to kill her, that the finger of men might not point at the fruit of sin in their father&apos;s house. But Jacob took a piece of tin, inscribed the Holy Name upon it, and bound it about the neck of the girl, and he put her under a thornbush, and abandoned her there. An angel carried the babe down to Egypt, where Potiphar adopted her as his child, for his wife was barren. Years thereafter, when Joseph travelled through the land as viceroy, the maidens threw gifts at him, to make him turn his eyes in their direction and give them the opportunity of gazing upon his beauty. Asenath possessed nothing that would do as a present, therefore she took off the amulet suspended from her neck, and gave it to him. Thus Joseph became acquainted with her lineage, and he married her, seeing that she was not an Egyptian, but one connected with the house of Jacob through her mother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Beside the son of Dinah, Simon had another son, whose name was Saul, by Bunah, the damsel he had taken captive in the campaign against Shechem.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Levi and Issachar married two daughters of Jobab, the grandson of Eber; the wife of the former was named Adinah, the wife of the latter, Aridah. Dan&apos;s wife was Elflalet, a daughter of the Moabite Hamudan. For a long time their marriage remained childless, finally they had a son, whom they called Hushim. Gad and Naphtali married women from Haran, two sisters, daughters of Amoram, a grandson of Nahor. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Naphtali&apos;s wife, Merimit, was the older of the two, and the younger, the wife of Gad, was named Uzit.</text:span></text:p>

She had been married before, her first husband having been Malchiel, also a grandson of Shem, and the issue of this first marriage was a daughter, Serah by name. When Asher brought his wife to Canaan, the three year old orphan Serah came with them. She was raised in the house of Jacob, and she walked in the way of pious children, and God gave her beauty, wisdom, and sagacity.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P33">When Joseph was sold as a slave to the Ishmaelites, he kept silent out of respect for his brethren, and did not tell his masters that he was a son of Jacob, a great and powerful man. Even when he came to the Midianites with the Ishmaelites, and the former asked after his parentage, he still said he was a slave, only in order not to put his brethren to shame. But the most distinguished of the Midianites rebuked Joseph, saying, &quot;Thou art no slave, thy appearance betrayeth thee,&quot; and he threatened him with death unless he acknowledged the truth. Joseph, however, was steadfast, he would not act treacherously toward his brethren.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Arrived in Egypt, the owners of Joseph could come to no agreement regarding him. Each desired to have sole and exclusive possession of him. They therefore decided to leave him with a shopkeeper until they should come back to Egypt again with their merchandise. And God let Joseph find grace in the sight of the shopkeeper. All that he had, his whole house, he put into Joseph&apos;s hand, and therefore the Lord blessed him with much silver and gold, and Joseph remained with him for three months and five days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">At that time there came from Memphis the wife of Potiphar, and she cast her eyes upon Joseph, of whose comeliness of person she had heard from the eunuchs. She told her husband how that a certain shopkeeper had grown rich through a young Hebrew, and she added: &quot;But it is said that the youth was stolen away out of the land of Canaan. Go, therefore, and sit in judgment upon his owner, and take the youth unto thy house, that the God of the Hebrews may bless thee, for the grace of heaven rests upon the youth.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Potiphar summoned the shopkeeper, and when he appeared before him, he spoke harshly to him, saying: &quot;What is this I hear? that thou stealest souls from the land of Canaan, and dost carry on traffic with them?&quot; The shop-keeper protested his innocence, and he could not be made to recede from his assertion, that a company of Ishmaelites had left Joseph in his charge temporarily, until they should return. Potiphar had him stripped naked and beaten, but he continued to reiterate the same statement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:soft-page-break/>Then Potiphar summoned Joseph. The youth prostrated himself before this chief of the eunuchs, for he was third in rank of the officers of Pharaoh. And he addressed Joseph, and said, &quot;Art thou a slave or a free-born man?&quot; and Joseph replied, &quot;A slave.&quot; Potiphar continued to question him, &quot;Whose slave art thou?&quot; Joseph: &quot;I belong to the Ishmaelites.&quot; Potiphar: &quot;How wast thou made a slave?&quot; Joseph: &quot;They bought me in the land of Canaan.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">But Potiphar refused to give credence to what he said, and he had also him stripped and beaten. The wife of Potiphar, standing by the door, saw how Joseph was abused, and she sent word to her husband, &quot;Thy verdict is unjust, for thou punishest the free-born youth that was stolen away from his place as though he were the one that had committed a crime.&quot; As Joseph held firmly to what he had said, Potiphar ordered him to prison, until his masters should return. In her sinful longing for him, his wife wanted to have Joseph in her own house, and she remonstrated with her husband in these words: &quot;Wherefore dost thou keep the captive, nobly-born slave a prisoner? Thou shouldst rather set him at liberty and have him serve thee.&quot; He answered, &quot;The law of the Egyptians does not permit us to take what belongs to another before all titles are made clear,&quot; and Joseph stayed in prison for twenty-four days, until the return of the Ishmaelites to Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Meanwhile they had heard somewhere that Joseph was the son of Jacob, and they therefore said to him: &quot;Why didst thou pretend that thou wast a slave? See, we have information that thou art the son of a powerful man in Canaan, and thy father mourns for thee in sackcloth.&quot; Joseph was on the point of divulging his secret, but he kept a check upon himself for the sake of his brethren, and he repeated that he was a slave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Nevertheless the Ishmaelites decided to sell him, that he be not found in their hands, for they feared the revenge of Jacob, who, they knew, was in high favor with the Lord and with men. The shopkeeper begged the Ishmaelites to rescue him from the legal prosecution of Potiphar, and clear him of the suspicion of man theft. The Ishmaelites in turn had a conference with Joseph, and bade him testify before Potiphar that they had bought him for money. He did so, and then the chief of the eunuchs liberated him from prison, and dismissed all parties concerned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:soft-page-break/>With the permission of her husband, Potiphar&apos;s wife sent a eunuch to the Ishmaelites, bidding him to buy Joseph, but he returned and reported that they demanded an exorbitant price for the slave. She dispatched a second eunuch, charging him to conclude the bargain, and though they asked one mina of gold, or even two, he was not to be sparing of money, he was to be sure to buy the slave and bring him to her. The eunuch gave the Ishmaelites eighty pieces of gold for Joseph, telling his mistress, however, that he had paid out a hundred pieces. Joseph noticed the deception, but he kept silent, that the eunuch might not be put to shame.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Thus Joseph became the slave of the idolatrous priest Potiphar, or Poti-phera, as he was sometimes called. He had secured possession of the handsome youth for a lewd purpose, but the angel Gabriel mutilated him in such manner that he could not accomplish it. His master soon had occasion to notice that Joseph was as pious as he was beautiful, for whenever he was occupied with his ministrations, he would whisper a prayer: &quot;O Lord of the world, Thou art my trust, Thou art my protection. Let me find grace and favor in Thy sight and in the sight of all that see me, and in the sight of my master Potiphar.&quot; When Potiphar noticed the movement of his lips, he said to Joseph, &quot;Dost thou purpose to cast a spell upon me?&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; replied the youth, &quot;I am beseeching God to let me find favor in thine eyes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">His prayer was heard. Potiphar convinced himself that God was with Joseph. Sometimes he would make a test of Joseph&apos;s miraculous powers. If he brought him a glass of hippocras, he would say, &quot;I would rather have wine mixed with absinthe,&quot; and straightway the spiced wine was changed into bitter wine. Whatever he desired, he could be sure to get from Joseph, and he saw clearly that God fulfilled the wishes of his slave. Therefore he put all the keys of his house into his hand, and he knew not aught that was with him, keeping back nothing from Joseph but his wife. Seeing that the Shekinah rested upon him, Potiphar treated Joseph not as a slave, but as a member of his family, for he said, &quot;This youth is not cut out for a slave&apos;s work, he is worthy of a prince&apos;s place.&quot; Accordingly, he provided instruction for him in the arts, and ordered him to have better fare than the other slaves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joseph thanked God for his new and happy state. He prayed, &quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, that Thou hast caused me to forget my father&apos;s house.&quot; What made his present </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">fortunes so agreeable was that he was removed from the envy and jealousy of his brethren. He said: &quot;When I was in my father&apos;s house, and he gave me something pretty, my brethren begrudged me the present, and now, O Lord, I thank Thee that I live amid plenty.&quot; Free from anxieties, he turned his attention to his external appearance. He painted his eyes, dressed his hair, and aimed to be elegant in his walk. But God spake to him, saying, &quot;Thy father is mourning in sackcloth and ashes, while thou dost eat, drink, and dress thy hair. Therefore I will stir up thy mistress against thee, and thou shalt be embarrassed.&quot; Thus Joseph&apos;s secret wish was fulfilled, that he might be permitted to prove his piety under temptation, as the piety of his fathers had been tested.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P75" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_7tjvxlgo0j2z"/>Haggada - Joseph and Zuleika</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">&quot;Throw the stick up in the air, it will always return to its original place.&quot; Like Rachel his mother, Joseph was of ravishing beauty, and the wife of his master was filled with invincible passion for him.&quot; Her feeling was heightened by the astrologic forecast that she was destined to have descendants through Joseph. This was true, but not in the sense in which she understood the prophecy. Joseph married her daughter Asenath later on, and she bore him children, thus fulfilling what had been read in the stars.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the beginning she did not confess her love to Joseph. She tried first to seduce him by artifice. On the pretext of visiting him, she would go to him at night, and, as she had no sons, she would pretend a desire to adopt him. Joseph then prayed to God in her behalf, and she bore a son. However, she continued to embrace him as though he were her own child, yet he did not notice her evil designs. Finally, when he recognized her wanton trickery, he mourned many days, and endeavored to turn her away from her sinful passion by the word of God. She, on her side, often threatened him with death, and surrendered him to castigations in order to make him amenable to her will, and when these means had no effect upon Joseph, she sought to seduce him with enticements. She would say, &quot;I promise thee, thou shalt rule over me and all I have, if thou wilt but give thyself up to me. and thou shalt be to me the same as my lawful husband.&quot; But Joseph was mindful of the words of his fathers, and he went </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">into his chamber, and fasted, and prayed to God, that He would deliver him from the toils of the Egyptian woman.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">In spite of the mortifications he practiced, and though he gave the poor and the sick the food apportioned to him, his master thought he lived a luxurious life, for those that fast for the glory of God are made beautiful of countenance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">The wife of Potiphar would frequently speak to her husband in praise of Joseph&apos;s chastity in order that he might conceive no suspicion of the state of her feelings. And, again, she would encourage Joseph secretly, telling him not to fear her husband, that he was convinced of his purity of life, and though one should carry tales to him about Joseph and herself, Potiphar would lend them no credence. And when she saw that all this was ineffectual , she approached him with the request that he teach her the word of God, saying, &quot;If it be thy wish that I forsake idol worship, then fulfil my desire, and I will persuade that Egyptian husband of mine to abjure the idols, and we shall walk in the law of thy God.&quot; Joseph replied, &quot;The Lord desireth not that those who fear Him shall walk in impurity, nor hath He pleasure in the adulterer.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Another time she came to him, and said, &quot;If thou wilt not do my desire, I will murder the Egyptian and wed with thee according to the law.&quot; Whereat Joseph rent his garment, and he said, &quot;O woman, fear the Lord, and do not execute this evil deed, that thou mayest not bring destruction down upon thyself, for I will proclaim thy impious purposes to all in public.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Again, she sent him a dish prepared with magic spells, by means of which she hoped to get him into her power. But when the eunuch set it before him, he saw the image of a man handing him a sword together with the dish, and, warned by the vision, he took good care not to taste of the food. A few days later his mistress came to him, and asked him why he had not eaten of what she had sent him. He reproached her, saying, &quot;How couldst thou tell me, I do not come nigh unto the idols, but only unto the Lord? The God of my fathers hath revealed thy iniquity to me through an angel, but that thou mayest know that the malice of the wicked has no power over those who fear God in purity, I shall eat thy food before thine eyes, and the God of my fathers and the angel of Abraham will be with me.&quot; The wife of Potiphar fell upon her face at the feet of Joseph, and amid tears she promised not to commit this sin again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:soft-page-break/>But her unholy passion for Joseph did not depart from her, and her distress over her unfulfilled wish made her look so ill that her husband said to her, &quot;Why is thy countenance fallen?&quot; And she replied, &quot;I have a pain at my heart, and the groanings of my spirit oppress me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Once when she was alone with Joseph, she rushed toward him, crying, &quot;I will throttle myself, or I will jump into a well or a pit, if thou wilt not yield thyself to me.&quot; Noticing her extreme agitation, Joseph endeavored to calm her with these words, &quot;Remember, if thou makest away with thyself, thy husband&apos;s concubine, Asteho, thy rival, will maltreat thy children, and extirpate thy memory from the earth.&quot; These words, gently spoken, had the opposite effect from that intended. They only inflamed her passion the more by feeding her hopes. She said: &quot;There, seest thou, thou dost love me now! It sufficeth for me that thou takest thought for me and for the safety of my children. I expect now that my desire will be fulfilled.&quot; She did not know that Joseph spoke as he did for the sake of God, and not for her sake.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">His mistress, or, as she was called, Zuleika, pursued him day after day with her amorous talk and her flattery, saying: &quot;How fair is thy appearance, how comely thy form! Never have I seen so well-favored a slave as thou art.&quot; Joseph would reply: &quot;God, who formed me in my mother&apos;s womb, hath created all men.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Zuleika: &quot;How beautiful are thine eyes, with which thou hast charmed all Egyptians, both men and women!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Joseph: &quot;Beautiful as they may be while I am alive, so ghastly they will be to look upon in the grave.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Zuleika: &quot;How lovely and pleasant are thy words! I pray thee, take thy harp, play and also sing, that I may hear thy words.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Joseph: &quot;Lovely and pleasant are my words when I proclaim the praise of my God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Zuleika: &quot;How beautiful is thy hair! Take my golden comb, and comb it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Joseph: &quot;How long wilt thou continue to speak thus to me? Leave off! It were better for thee to care for thy household.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:soft-page-break/>Zuleika: &quot;There is nothing in my house that I care for, save thee alone.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">But Joseph&apos;s virtue was unshaken. While she spoke thus, he did not so much as raise his eyes to look at his mistress. He remained equally steadfast when she lavished gifts upon him, for she provided him with garments of one kind for the morning, another for noon, and a third kind for the evening. Nor could threats move him. She would say, &quot;I will bring false accusations against thee before thy master,&quot; and Joseph would reply, &quot;The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed.&quot; Or, &quot;I will deprive thee of food;&quot; whereupon Joseph, &quot;The Lord giveth food to the hungry.&quot; Or, &quot;I will have thee thrown into prison;&quot; whereupon Joseph, &quot;The Lord looseth the prisoners.&quot; Or, &quot;I will put heavy labor upon thee that will bend thee double;&quot; whereupon Joseph, &quot;The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down.&quot; Or, &quot;I will blind thine eyes;&quot; whereupon Joseph, &quot;The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">When she began to exercise her blandishments upon him, he rejected them with the words, &quot;I fear my master.&quot; But Zuleika would say, &quot;I will kill him.&quot; Joseph replied with indignation, &quot;Not enough that thou wouldst make an adulterer of me, thou wouldst have me be a murderer, besides?&quot; And he spoke furthermore, saying, &quot;I fear the Lord my God!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Zuleika: &quot;Nonsense! He is not here to see thee!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Joseph: &quot;Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thereupon she took Joseph into her chamber, where an idol hung above the bed. This she covered, that it might not be a witness of what she was about to do. Joseph said: &quot;Though thou coverest up the eyes of the idol, remember, the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth. Yes,&quot; continued Joseph, &quot;I have many reasons not to do this thing for the sake of God. Adam was banished from Paradise on account of violating a light command; how much more should I have to fear the punishment of God, were I to commit so grave a sin as adultery! The Lord is in the habit of choosing a favorite member of our family as a sacrifice unto Himself. Perhaps He desireth to make choice of me, but if I do thy will, I make myself unfit to be a sacrifice unto God. Also the Lord is in the habit of appearing suddenly, in visions </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">of the night, unto those that love Him. Thus did He appear unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I fear that He may appear unto me at the very moment while I am defiling myself with thee. And as I fear God, so I fear my father, who withdrew the birthright from his first-born son Reuben, on account of an immoral act, and gave it to me. Were I to fulfil thy desire, I would share the fate of my brother Reuben.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">With such words, Joseph endeavored to cure the wife of his master of the wanton passion she had conceived for him, while he took heed to keep far from a heinous sin, not from fear of the punishment that would follow, nor out of consideration for the opinion of men, but because he desired to sanctify the Name of God, blessed be He, before the whole world. It was this feeling of his that Zuleika could not comprehend, and when, finally, carried away by passion, she told him in unmistakable language what she desired, and he recoiled from her, she said to Joseph: &quot;Why dost thou refuse to fulfil my wish? Am I not a married woman? None will find out what thou hast done.&quot; Joseph replied: &quot;If the unmarried women of the heathen are prohibited unto us, how much more their married women? As the Lord liveth, I will not commit the crime thou biddest me do.&quot; In this Joseph followed the example of many pious men, who utter an oath at the moment when they are in danger of succumbing to temptation, and seek thus to gather moral courage to control their evil instincts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">When Zuleika could not prevail upon him, to persuade him, her desire threw her into a grievous sickness, and all the women of Egypt came to visit her, and they said unto her, &quot;Why art thou so languid and wasted, thou that lackest nothing? Is not thy husband a prince great and esteemed in the sight of the king? Is it possible that thou canst want aught of what thy heart desireth?&quot; Zuleika answered them, saying, &quot;This day shall it be made known unto you whence cometh the state wherein you see me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:span text:style-name="T15">She commanded her maid-servants to prepare food for all the women, and she spread a banquet before them in her house. She placed knives upon the table to peel the oranges, and then ordered Joseph to appear, arrayed in costly garments, and wait upon her guests. When Joseph came in, the women could not take their eyes off him, and they all cut their hands with the knives, and the oranges in their hands were </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">covered with blood, but they, not knowing what they were doing, continued to look upon the beauty of Joseph without turning their eyes away from him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Then Zuleika said unto them: &quot;What have ye done? Behold, I set oranges before you to eat, and you have cut your hands.&quot; All the women looked at their hands, and, lo, they were full of blood, and it flowed down and stained their garments. They said to Zuleika, &quot;This slave in thy house did enchant us, and we could not turn our eyes away from him on account of his beauty.&quot; She then said: &quot;This happened to you that looked upon him but a moment, and you could not refrain yourselves! How, then, can I control myself in whose house he abideth continually, who see him go in and out day after day? How, then, should I not waste away, or keep from languishing on account of him!&quot; And the women spake, saying: &quot;It is true, who can look upon this beauty in the house, and refrain her feelings? But he is thy slave! Why dost thou not disclose to him that which is in thy heart, rather than suffer thy life to perish through this thing?&quot; Zuleika answered them: &quot;Daily do I endeavor to persuade him, but he will not consent to my wishes. I promised him everything that is fair, yet have I met with no return from him, and therefore I am sick, as you may see.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Her sickness increased upon her. Her husband and her household suspected not the cause of her decline, but all the women that were her friends knew that it was on account of the love she bore Joseph, and they advised her all the time to try to entice the youth. On a certain day, while Joseph was doing his master&apos;s work in the house, Zuleika came and fell suddenly upon him, but Joseph was stronger than she, and he pressed her down to the ground. Zuleika wept, and in a voice of supplication, and in bitterness of soul, she said to Joseph: &quot;Hast thou ever known, seen, or heard of a woman my peer in beauty, let alone a woman with beauty exceeding mine? Yet I try daily to persuade thee, I fall into decline through love of thee, I confer all this honor upon thee, and thou wilt not hearken unto my voice! Is it by reason of fear of thy master, that he punish thee? As the king liveth, no harm shall come upon thee from thy master on account of this thing. Now, therefore, I pray thee, listen to me, and consent unto my desire for the sake of the honor that I have conferred upon thee, and take this death away from me. For why should I die on account of thee?&quot; Joseph remained as steadfast under these importunities as before. Zuleika, however, was not discouraged; she continued her solicitations unremittingly, day after day, month </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">after month, for a whole year, but always without the least success, for Joseph in his chastity did not permit himself even to look upon her, wherefore she resorted to constraint. She had an iron shackle placed upon his chin, and he was compelled to keep his head up and look her in the face.&quot;</text:span></text:p>

He has put all his possessions in my charge. In this house I am his equal; he hasn’t withheld anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?” But she kept pressing him, day after day. Nevertheless, he didn’t listen to her; he refused to sleep with her or even be with her.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing that she could not attain her object by entreaties or tears, Zuleika finally used force, when she judged that the favorable chance had come. She did not have long to wait. When the Nile overflowed its banks, and, according to the annual custom of the Egyptians, all repaired to the river, men and women, people and princes, accompanied by music, Zuleika remained at home under pretense of being sick. This was her long-looked-for opportunity, she thought. She rose up and ascended to the hall of state, and arrayed herself in princely garments. She placed precious stones upon her head, onyx stones set in silver and gold, she beautified her face and her body with all sorts of things for the purifying of women, she perfumed the hall and the whole house with cassia and frankincense, spread myrrh and aloes all over, and afterward sat herself down at the entrance to the hall, in the vestibule leading to the house, through which Joseph had to pass to his work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">And, behold, Joseph came from the field, and he was on the point of entering the house to do his master&apos;s work, but when he reached the place where Zuleika sat, and saw all she had done, he turned back. His mistress, perceiving it, called out to him, &quot;What aileth thee, Joseph? Go to thy work, I will make room for thee, that thou </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">mayest pass by to thy seat.&quot; Joseph did as she bade him, he entered the house, took his seat, and set about his master&apos;s work as usual. Then Zuleika stood before him suddenly in all her beauty of person and magnificence of raiment, and repeated the desire of her heart. It was the first and the last time that Joseph&apos;s steadfastness deserted him, but only for an instant. When he was on the point of complying with the wish of his mistress, the image of his mother Rachel appeared before him, and that of his aunt Leah, and the image of his father Jacob. The last addressed him thus: &quot;In time to come the names of thy brethren will be graven upon the breastplate of the high priest. Dost thou desire to have thy name appear with theirs? Or wilt thou forfeit this honor through sinful conduct? For know, he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance.&quot; This vision of the dead, and especially the image of his father, brought Joseph to his senses, and his illicit passion departed from him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Astonished at the swift change in his countenance, Zuleika said, &quot;My friend and true-love, why art thou so affrighted that thou art near to swooning?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;I see my father!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zuleika: &quot;Where is he? Why, there is none in the house.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Thou belongest to a people that is like unto the ass, it perceiveth nothing. But I belong to those who can see things.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph fled forth, away from the house of his mistress, the same house in which aforetime wonders had been done for Sarah kept a captive there by Pharaoh. But hardly was he outside when the sinful passion again overwhelmed him, and he returned to Zuleika&apos;s chamber. Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: &quot;If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.&quot; Sobered again, Joseph started to escape from his mistress, but Zuleika caught him by his garment, and she said: &quot;As the king liveth, if thou wilt not fulfil my wish, thou must die,&quot; and while she spoke thus, she drew a sword with her free hand from under her dress, and, pressing it against Joseph&apos;s throat, she said, &quot;Do as I bid thee, or thou diest.&quot; Joseph ran out, leaving a piece of his garment in the hands of Zuleika as he wrenched himself loose from the grasp of the woman with a quick, energetic motion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Zuleika&apos;s passion for Joseph was so violent that, in lieu of its owner, whom she could not succeed in subduing to her will, she kissed and caressed the fragment of cloth left in her hand. At the same time she was not slow to perceive the danger into which she had put herself, for, she feared, Joseph might possibly betray her conduct, and she considered ways and means of obviating the consequences of her folly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Meanwhile her friends returned from the Nile festival, and they came to visit her and inquire after her health. They found her looking wretchedly ill, on account of the excitement she had passed through and the anxiety she was in. She confessed to the women what had happened with Joseph, and they advised her to accuse him of immorality before her husband, and then he would be thrown into prison. Zuleika accepted their advice, and she begged her visitors to support her charges by also lodging complaints against Joseph, that he had been annoying them with improper proposals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Zuleika did not depend entirely upon the assistance of her friends. She planned a ruse, besides, to be sure of convincing her husband of Joseph&apos;s guilt. She laid aside her rich robes of state, put on her ordinary clothes, and took to her sick-bed, in which she had been lying when the people left to go to the festival. Also she took Joseph&apos;s torn garment, and laid it out next to her. Then she sent a little boy to summon some of the men of her house, and to them she told the tale of Joseph&apos;s alleged outrage, saying: &quot;See the Hebrew slave, whom your master hath brought in unto my house, and who attempted to do violence to me to-day! You had scarcely gone away to the festival when be entered the house, and making sure that no one was here he tried to force me to yield to his lustful desire. But I grasped his clothes, tore them, and cried with a loud voice. When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he was seized with fear, and be fled, and got him out, but he left his garment by me.&quot; The men of her house spake not a word, but, in a rage against Joseph, they went to their master, and reported to him what had come to pass. In the meantime the husbands of Zuleika&apos;s friends had also spoken to Potiphar, at the instigation of their wives, and complained of his slave, that he molested them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Potiphar hastened home, and he found his wife in low spirits, and though the cause of her dejection was chagrin at not having succeeded in winning Joseph&apos;s love, she </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">pretended that it was anger at the immoral conduct of the slave. She accused him in the following words: &quot;O husband, mayest thou not live a day longer, if thou dost not punish the wicked slave that hath desired to defile thy bed, that hath not kept in mind who he was when he came to our house, to demean himself with modesty, nor hath he been mindful of the favors he hath received from thy bounty. He did lay a privy design to abuse thy wife, and this at the time of observing a festival, when thou wouldst be absent.&quot; These words she spoke at the moment of conjugal intimacy with Potiphar, when she was certain of exerting an influence upon her husband.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Potiphar gave credence to her words, and he had Joseph flogged unmercifully. While the cruel blows fell upon him, he cried to God, &quot;O Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent of these things, and why should I die to-day on account of a false accusation by the hands of these uncircumcised, impious men?&quot; God opened the mouth of Zuleika&apos;s child, a babe of but eleven months, and he spoke to the men that were beating Joseph, saying: &quot;What is your quarrel with this man? Why do you inflict such evil upon him? Lies my mother doth speak, and deceit is what her mouth uttereth. This is the true tale of that which did happen,&quot; and the child proceeded to tell all that had passed--how Zuleika had tried first to persuade Joseph to act wickedly, and then had tried to force him to do her will. The people listened in great amazement. But the report finished, the child spake no word, as before.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Abashed by the speech of his own infant son, Potiphar commanded his bailiffs to leave off from chastising Joseph, and the matter was brought into court, where priests sat as judges. Joseph protested his innocence, and related all that had happened according to the truth, but Potiphar repeated the account his wife had given him. The judges ordered the garment of Joseph to be brought which Zuleika had in her possession, and they examined the tear therein. It turned out to be on the front part of the mantle, and they came to the conclusion that Zuleika had tried to hold him fast, and had been foiled in her attempt by Joseph, against whom she was now lodging a trumped up charge. They decided that Joseph had not incurred the death penalty, but they condemned him to incarceration, because he was the cause of a stain upon Zuleika&apos;s fair name.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Potiphar himself was convinced of Joseph&apos;s innocence, and when he cast him into prison, he said to him, &quot;I know that thou art not guilty of so vile a crime, but I must put thee in durance, lest a taint cling to my children.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">However, one day, when he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men living in the house was there indoors, she grabbed him by his robe and said, “Sleep with me!” But he fled, leaving his robe in her hand, and got himself outside. When she saw that he had left his robe in her hand and had escaped, she called the men of her house and said to them, “Look at this! My husband brought in a Hebrew to make fools of us. He came in and wanted to sleep with me, but I yelled out loudly. When he heard me yelling like that, he left his robe with me and ran out.” She put the robe aside until his master came home. Then she said to him, “This Hebrew slave you brought us came in to make a fool of me. But when I yelled out, he left his robe with me and fled outside.” When his master heard what his wife said as she showed him, “Here’s what your slave did to me,” he became furious. Yosef’s master took him and put him in prison, in the place where the king’s prisoners were kept; and there he was in the prison.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_5g5ubke9eyhh"/>Haggada - Joseph in Prison</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">By way of punishment for having traduced his ten brethren before his father, Joseph had to languish for ten years in the prison to which the wiles of traducers had in turn condemned him. But, on the other hand, as he had sanctified the Name of God before the world by his chastity and his steadfastness, he was rewarded. The letter He, which occurs twice in the Name of God, was added to his name. He had been called Joseph, but now he was called also Jehoseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Though he was bound in prison, Joseph was not yet safe from the machinations of his mistress, whose passion for him was in no wise lessened. In truth it was she that had induced her husband to change his intention regarding Joseph; she urged him to imprison the slave rather than kill him, for she hoped that as a prisoner he could be made amenable to her wishes more easily. She spake to her husband, saying: &quot;Do not destroy thy property. Cast the slave in prison and keep him there until thou canst </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">sell him, and receive back the money thou didst pay out for him.&quot; Thus she had the opportunity of visiting Joseph in his cell and trying to persuade him to do her will. She would say, &quot;This and that outrage have I executed against thee, but, as thou livest, I will put yet other outrages upon thee if thou dost not obey me.&quot; But Joseph replied, &quot;The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zuleika: &quot;I will push matters so far that all men will hate thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;The Lord loveth the righteous.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zuleika: &quot;I will sell thee into a strange land.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;The Lord preserveth the strangers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then she would resort to enticements in order to obtain her desire. She would promise to release him from prison, if he would but grant her wish. But he would say, &quot;Better it is to remain here than be with thee and commit a trespass against God.&quot; These visits to Joseph in prison Zuleika continued for a long time, but when, finally, she saw that all her hopes were vain, she let him alone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As the mistress persisted in her love for Joseph, so his master, her husband, could not separate himself from his favorite slave. Though a prisoner, Joseph continued to minister to the needs of Potiphar, and he received permission from the keeper of the prison to spend some of his time in his master&apos;s house. In many other ways the jailer showed himself kindly disposed toward Joseph. Seeing the youth&apos;s zeal and conscientiousness in executing the tasks laid upon him, and under the spell of his enchanting beauty, he made prison life as easy as possible for his charge. He even ordered better dishes for him than the common prison fare, and he found it superfluous caution to keep watch over Joseph, for he could see no wrong in him, and he observed that God was with him, in good days and in bad. He even appointed him to be the overseer of the prison, and as Joseph commanded, so the other prisoners were obliged to do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">For a long time the people talked of nothing but the accusation raised against Joseph by his mistress. In order to divert the attention of the public from him, God ordained that two high officers, the chief butler and the chief baker, should offend </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">their lord, the king of Egypt, and they were put in ward in the house of the captain of the guard. Now the people ceased their talk about Joseph, and spoke only of the scandal at court. The charges laid at the door of the noble prisoners were that they had attempted to do violence to the daughter of Pharaoh, and they had conspired to poison the king himself. Besides, they had shown themselves derelict in their service. In the wine the chief butler had handed to the king to drink, a fly had been discovered, and the bread set upon the royal board by the chief baker contained a little pebble.&quot; On account of all these transgressions they were condemned to death by Pharaoh, but for the sake of Joseph it was ordained by Divine providence that the king should first detain them in prison before he ordered their execution. The Lord had enkindled the wrath of the king against his servants only that the wish of Joseph for liberty might be fulfilled, for they were the instruments of his deliverance from prison, and though they were doomed to death, yet in consideration of the exalted office they had held at court, the keeper of the prison accorded them privileges, as, for instance, a man was detailed to wait upon them, and the one appointed thereto was Joseph. 1]</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The chief butler and the chief baker had been confined in prison ten years, when they dreamed a dream, both of them, but as for the interpretation, each dreamed only that of the other one&apos;s dream. In the morning when Joseph brought them the water for washing, he found them sad, depressed in spirits, and, in the manner of the sages, he asked them why they looked different on that day from other days. They said unto him, &quot;We have dreamed a dream this night, and our two dreams resemble each other in certain particulars, and there is none that can interpret them.&quot; And Joseph said unto them: &quot;God granteth understanding to man to interpret dreams. Tell them me, I pray you.&quot; It was as a reward for ascribing greatness and credit to Him unto whom it belongeth that Joseph later attained to his lofty position.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The chief butler proceeded to tell his dream: &quot;In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; and in the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes; and Pharaoh&apos;s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh&apos;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&apos;s hand.&quot; The chief butler was not aware that his dream contained a prophecy regarding the future of Israel, but Joseph </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">discerned the recondite meaning, and he interpreted the dream thus: The three branches are the three Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose descendants in Egypt will be redeemed by three leaders, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; and the cup given into the hand of Pharaoh is the cup of wrath that he will have to drain in the end. This interpretation of the dream Joseph kept for himself, and he told the chief butler nothing thereof, but out of gratitude for the glad tidings of the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, he gave him a favorable interpretation of his dream, and begged him to have him in his remembrance, when it should be well with him, and liberate him from the dungeon in which he was confined.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the chief baker heard the interpretation of the butler&apos;s dream, he knew that Joseph had divined its meaning correctly, for in his own he had seen the interpretation of his friend&apos;s dream, and he proceeded to tell Joseph what he had dreamed in the night: &quot;I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head; and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.&quot; Also this dream conveyed a prophecy regarding the future of Israel: The three baskets are the three kingdoms to which Israel will be made subject, Babylon, Media, and Greece; and the uppermost basket indicates the wicked rule of Rome, which will extend over all the nations of the world, until the bird shall come, who is the Messiah, and annihilate Rome. Again Joseph kept the prophecy a secret. To the chief baker he gave only the interpretation that had reference to his person, but it was unfavorable to him, because through his dream Joseph had been made acquainted with the suffering Israel would have to undergo.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">And all came to pass, as Joseph had said, on the third day. The day whereon he explained the meaning of their dreams to the two distinguished prisoners, a son was born unto Pharaoh and to celebrate the joyous event, the king arranged a feast for his princes and servants that was to last eight days. He invited them and all the people to his table, and he entertained them with royal splendor. The feast had its beginning on the third day after the birth of the child, and on that occasion the chief butler was restored in honor to his butlership, and the chief baker was hanged, for Pharaoh&apos;s counsellors had discovered that it was not the butler&apos;s fault that the fly had dropped into the king&apos;s wine, but the baker had been guilty of carelessness in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">allowing the pebble to get into the bread. Likewise it appeared that the butler had had no part in the conspiracy to poison the king, while the baker was revealed as one of the plotters, and he had to expiate his crime with his life.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Some time later it came about that the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker gave offense to their lord the king of Egypt. Pharaoh became angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, in the same place where Yosef was kept. The captain of the guard charged Yosef to be with them, and he became their attendant while they remained in prison.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One night the two of them, the king of Egypt’s cupbearer and his baker, there in prison, both had dreams, each dream with its own meaning. Yosef came in to them in the morning and saw that they looked sad. He asked Pharaoh’s officers there with him in the prison of his master’s house, “Why are you looking so sad today?” They said to him, “We each had a dream, and there’s no one around who can interpret it.” Yosef said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me, please.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then the chief cupbearer told Yosef his dream: “In my dream, there in front of me was a vine, and the vine had three branches. The branches budded, then it suddenly began to blossom, and finally clusters of ripe grapes appeared. Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and gave the cup to Pharaoh.” Yosef said to him, “Here is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office: you will be giving Pharaoh his cup as you used to when you were his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">cupbearer. But remember me when it goes well with you; and show me kindness, please; and mention me to Pharaoh, so that he will release me from this prison. For the truth is that I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here too I have done nothing wrong that would justify putting me in this dungeon.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Yosef, “I too saw in my dream: there were three baskets of white bread on my head. In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” Yosef answered, “Here is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days. Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from off of you — he will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he gave a party for all his officials, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his officials. He restored the chief cupbearer back to his position, so that he again gave Pharaoh his cup. But he hanged the chief baker, as Yosef had interpreted to them. Nevertheless, the chief cupbearer didn’t remember Yosef, but forgot him.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the end of two years, Pharaoh had a dream: he was standing beside the Nile River; and there came up out of the river seven cows, sleek and fat; and they began feeding in swamp grass. After them, there came up out of the river seven more cows, miserable-looking and lean; and they stood by the other cows at the edge of the river. Then the miserable-looking and lean cows ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. At this point Pharaoh woke up. But he went to sleep again and dreamt a second time: seven full, ripe ears of grain grew out of a single stalk. After them, seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven full, ripe ears. Then Pharaoh woke up and realized it had been a dream.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_9mewftbaq076"/>Haggada - Pharaoh’s Dreams</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Properly speaking, Joseph should have gone out free from his dungeon on the same day as the butler. He had been there ten years by that time, and had made amends for the slander he had uttered against his ten brethren. However, he remained in prison two years longer. &quot;Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope is the Lord,&quot; but Joseph had put his confidence in flesh and blood. He had prayed the chief butler to have him in remembrance when it should be well with him, and make mention of him unto Pharaoh, and the butler forgot his promise, and therefore Joseph had to stay in prison two years more than the years originally allotted to him there. The butler had not forgotten him intentionally, but it was ordained of God that his memory should fail him. When he would say to himself, If thus and so happens, I will remember the case of Joseph, the conditions he had imagined were sure to be reversed, or if he made a knot as a reminder, an angel came and undid the knot, and Joseph did not enter his mind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But &quot;the Lord setteth an end to darkness,&quot; and Joseph&apos;s liberation was not delayed by a single moment beyond the time decreed for it. God said, &quot;Thou, O butler, thou didst forget Joseph, but I did not,&quot; and He caused Pharaoh to dream a dream that was the occasion for Joseph&apos;s release.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>In his dream Pharaoh saw seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed, come up out of the Nile, and they all together grazed peaceably on the brink of the river, In years when the harvest is abundant, friendship reigns among men, and love and brotherly harmony, and these seven fat kine stood for seven such prosperous years. After the fat kine, seven more came up out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and each had her back turned to the others, for when distress prevails, one man turns away from the other. For a brief space Pharaoh awoke, and when he went to sleep again, he dreamed a second dream, about seven rank and good ears of corn, and seven ears that were thin and blasted with the east wind, the withered cars swallowing the full ears. He awoke at once, and it was morning, and dreams dreamed in the morning are the ones that come true.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This was not the first time Pharaoh had had these dreams. They had visited him every night during a period of two years, and he had forgotten them invariably in the morning. This was the first time he remembered them, for the day had arrived for Joseph to come forth from his prison house. Pharaoh&apos;s heart beat violently when he called his dreams to mind on awaking. Especially the second one, about the ears of corn, disquieted him. He reflected that whatever has a mouth can eat, and therefore the dream of the seven lean kine that ate up the seven fat kine did not appear strange to him. But the ears of corn that swallowed up other ears of corn troubled his spirit. He therefore called for all the wise men of his land, and they endeavored in vain to find a satisfactory interpretation. They explained that the seven fat kine meant seven daughters to be born unto Pharaoh, and the seven lean kine, that he would bury seven daughters; the rank ears of corn meant that Pharaoh would conquer seven countries, and the blasted ears, that seven provinces would rebel against him. About the ears of corn they did not all agree. Some thought the good ears stood for seven cities to be built by Pharaoh, and the seven withered ears indicated that these same cities would be destroyed at the end of his reign.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Sagacious as he was, Pharaoh knew that none of these explanations hit the nail on the head. He issued a decree summoning all interpreters of dreams to appear before him on pain of death, and he held out great rewards and distinctions to the one who should succeed in finding the true meaning of his dreams. In obedience to his summons, all the wise men appeared, the magicians and the sacred scribes that </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">were in Mizraim, the city of Egypt, as well as those from Goshen, Raamses, Zoan, and the whole country of Egypt, and with them came the princes, officers, and servants of the king from all the cities of the land.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">To all these the king narrated his dreams, but none could interpret them to his satisfaction. Some said that the seven fat kine were the seven legitimate kings that would rule over Egypt, and the seven lean kine betokened seven princes that would rise up against these seven kings and exterminate them. The seven good ears of corn were the seven superior princes of Egypt that would engage in a war for their overlord, and would be defeated by as many insignificant princes, who were betokened by the seven blasted ears.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Another interpretation was that the seven fat kine were the seven fortified cities of Egypt, at some future time to fall into the hands of seven Canaanitish nations, who were foreshadowed in the seven lean kine. According to this interpretation, the second dream supplemented the first. It meant that the descendants of Pharaoh would regain sovereign authority over Egypt at a subsequent period, and would subdue the seven Canaanitish nations as well.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">There was a third interpretation, given by some: The seven fat kine are seven women whom Pharaoh would take to wife, but they would die during his lifetime, their loss being indicated by the seven lean kine. Furthermore, Pharaoh would have fourteen sons, and the seven strong ones would be conquered by the seven weaklings, as the blasted ears of corn in his dream had swallowed up the rank ears of corn.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And a fourth: &quot;Thou wilt have seven sons, O Pharaoh, these are the seven fat kine. These sons of thine will be killed by the seven powerful rebellious princes. But then seven minor princes will come, and they will kill the seven rebels, avenge thy descendants, and restore the dominion to thy family.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The king was as little pleased with these interpretations as with the others, which he had heard before, and in his wrath he ordered the wise men, the magicians and the scribes of Egypt, to be killed, and the hangmen made ready to execute the royal decree.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>However, Mirod, Pharaoh&apos;s chief butler, took fright, seeing that the king was so vexed at his failure to secure an interpretation of his dreams that he was on the point of giving up the ghost. He was alarmed about the king&apos;s death, for it was doubtful whether the successor to the throne would retain him in office. He resolved to do all in his power to keep Pharaoh alive. Therefore he stepped before him, and spake, saying, &quot;I do remember two faults of mine this day, I showed myself ungrateful to Joseph, in that I did not bring his request before thee, and also I saw thee in distress by reason of thy dream, without letting thee know that Joseph can interpret dreams. When it pleased the Lord God to make Pharaoh wroth with his servants, the king put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. And with us there was a simple young man, one of the despised race of the Hebrews, slave to the captain of the guard, and he interpreted our dreams to us, and it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was. Therefore, O king, stay the hand of the hangmen, let them not execute the Egyptians. The slave I speak of is still in the dungeon, and if the king will consent to summon him hither, he will surely interpret thy dreams.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_lhnlp8kenhzw"/>Genesis Continued…</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the morning he found himself so upset that he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one there could interpret them for him. Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today reminds me of something wherein I am at fault: Pharaoh was angry with his officials and put me in the prison of the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. One night both I and he had dreams, and each man’s dream had its own meaning. There was with us a young man, a Hebrew, a servant of the captain of the guard; and we told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us — he interpreted each man’s dream individually. And it came about as he interpreted to us — I was restored to my office, and he was hanged.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Pharaoh summoned Yosef, and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothes, and came in to Pharaoh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(A: ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Pharaoh said to Yosef, “I had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; but I’ve heard it said about you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.” Yosef answered Pharaoh, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer that will set </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">his mind at peace.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(S: ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Pharaoh said to Yosef, “In my dream, I stood at the edge of the river; and there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and sleek; and they began feeding in the swamp grass. After them, there came up out of the river seven more cows, poor, miserable-looking and lean — I’ve never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt! Then the lean and miserable-looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows. But after they had eaten them up, one couldn’t tell that they had eaten them; because they were as miserable-looking as before. At this point I woke up. But I dreamed again and saw seven full, ripe ears of grain growing out of a single stalk. After them, seven ears, thin and blasted by the east wind, sprang up. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven ripe ears. I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yosef said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are the same: God has told Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain are seven years — the dreams are the same. Likewise the seven lean and miserable-looking cows that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted by the east wind — there will be seven years of famine. This is what I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. Here it is: there will be seven years of abundance throughout the whole land of Egypt; but afterwards, there will come seven years of famine; and Egypt will forget all the abundance. The famine will consume the land, and the abundance will not be known in the land because of the famine that will follow, because it will be truly terrible. Why was the dream doubled for Pharaoh? Because the matter has been fixed by God, and God will shortly cause it to happen.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Therefore, Pharaoh should look for a man both discreet and wise to put in charge of the land of Egypt. Pharaoh should do this, and he should appoint supervisors over the land to receive a twenty percent tax on the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. They should gather all the food produced during these good years coming up and set aside grain under the supervision of Pharaoh to be used for food in the cities, and they should store it. This will be the land’s food supply for the seven years of famine that will come over the land of Egypt, so that the land will not perish as a result of the famine.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The proposal seemed good both to Pharaoh and to all his officials. Pharaoh said to his officials, “Can we find anyone else like him? The Spirit of God lives in him!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So Pharaoh said to Yosef, “Since God has shown you all this — there is no one as discerning and wise as you — you will be in charge of my household; all my people will be ruled by what you say. Only when I rule from my throne will I be greater than you.” Pharaoh said to Yosef, “Here, I place you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.” Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Yosef’s hand, had him clothed in fine linen with a gold chain around his neck and had him ride in his second best chariot; and they cried before him, “Bow down!” Thus he placed him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. Pharaoh said to Yosef, “I, Pharaoh, decree that without your approval no one is to raise his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” Pharaoh called Yosef by the name Tzafnat-Pa‘neach and gave him as his wife Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On. Then Yosef went out through all the land of Egypt.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Joseph reaped the harvest of his virtues, and according to the measure of his merits God granted him reward. The mouth that refused the kiss of unlawful passion and sin received the kiss of homage from the people; the neck that did not bow itself unto sin was adorned with the gold chain that Pharaoh put upon it; the hands that did not touch sin wore the signet ring that Pharaoh took from his own hand and put upon Joseph&apos;s; the body that did not come in contact with sin was arrayed in vestures of byssus; the feet that made no steps in the direction of sin reposed in the royal chariot, and the thoughts that kept themselves undefiled by sin were proclaimed as wisdom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joseph was installed in his high position, and invested with the insignia of his office, with solemn ceremony. The king took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph&apos;s hand, and arrayed him in princely apparel, and set a gold crown upon his head, and laid a gold chain about his neck. Then he commanded his servants to make Joseph to ride in his second chariot, which went by the side of the chariot wherein sat the king, and he also made him to ride upon a great and strong horse of the king&apos;s horses, and his servants conducted him through the streets of the city of Egypt. Musicians, no less than a thousand striking cymbals and a thousand blowing </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">flutes, and five thousand men with drawn swords gleaming in the air formed the vanguard. Twenty thousand of the king&apos;s grandees girt with gold-embroidered leather belts marched at the right of Joseph, and as many at the left of him. The women and the maidens of the nobility looked out of the windows to gaze upon Joseph&apos;s beauty, and they poured down chains upon him, and rings and jewels, that he might but direct his eyes toward them. Yet he did not look up, and as a reward God made him proof against the evil eye, nor has it ever had the power of inflicting harm upon any of his descendants. Servants of the king, preceding him and following him, burnt incense upon his path, and cassia, and all manner of sweet spices, and strewed myrrh and aloes wherever he went. Twenty heralds walked before him, and they proclaimed: &quot;This is the man whom the king bath chosen to be the second after him. All the affairs of state will be administered by him, and whoever resisteth his commands, or refuseth to bow down to the ground before him, he will die the death of the rebel against the king and the king&apos;s deputy.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Without delay the people prostrated themselves, and they cried, &quot;Long live the king, and long live the deputy of the king!&quot; And Joseph, looking down from his horse upon the people and their exultation, exclaimed, his eyes directed heavenward: &quot;The Lord raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After Joseph, accompanied by Pharaoh&apos;s officers and princes, had journeyed through the whole city of Egypt, and viewed all there was therein, he returned to the king on the selfsame day, and the king gave him fields and vineyards as a present, and also three thousand talents of silver, and a thousand talents of gold, and onyx stones and bdellium, and many other costly things. The king commanded, moreover, that every Egyptian give Joseph a gift, else he would be put to death. A platform was erected in the open street, and there all deposited their presents, and among the things were many of gold and silver, as well as precious stones, carried thither by the people and also the grandees, for they saw that Joseph enjoyed the favor of the king. Furthermore, Joseph received one hundred slaves from Pharaoh, and they were to do all his bidding, and he himself acquired many more, for he resided in a spacious palace. Three years it took to build it. Special magnificence was lavished upon the hall of state, which was his audience chamber, and upon the throne fashioned of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">gold and silver and inlaid with precious stones, whereon there was a representation of the whole land of Egypt and of the river Nile. And as Joseph multiplied in riches, so he increased also in wisdom, for God added to his wisdom that all might love and honor him. Pharaoh called him Zaphenath-paneah, he who can reveal secret things with ease, and rejoiceth the heart of man therewith. Each letter of the name Zaphenath-paneah has a meaning, too. The first, Zadde, stands for Zofeh, seer; Pe for Podeh, redeemer; Nun for Nabi, prophet; Taw for Tomek, supporter; Pe for Poter, interpreter of dreams; Ain for Arum, clever; Nun for Nabon, discreet; and Het for Hakam, wise.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The name of Joseph&apos;s wife pointed to her history in the same way. Asenath was the daughter of Dinah and Hamor, but she was abandoned at the borders of Egypt, only, that people might know who she was, Jacob engraved the story of her parentage and her birth upon a gold plate fastened around her neck. The day on which Asenath was exposed, Potiphar went walking with his servants near the city wall, and they heard the voice of a child. At the captain&apos;s bidding they brought the baby to him, and when he read her history from the gold plate, he determined to adopt her. He took her home with him, and raised her as his daughter. The Alef in Asenath stands for On, where Potiphar was priest; the Samek for Setirah, Hidden, for she was kept concealed on account of her extraordinary beauty; the Nun for Nohemet, for she wept and entreated that she might be delivered from the house of the heathen Potiphar; and the Taw for Tammah, the perfect one, on account of her pious, perfect deeds.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Asenath had saved Joseph&apos;s life while she was still an infant in arms. When Joseph was accused of immoral conduct by Potiphar&apos;s wife and the other women, and his master was on the point of having him hanged, Asenath approached her foster-father, and she assured him under oath that the charge against Joseph was false. Then spake God, &quot;As thou livest, because thou didst try to defend Joseph, thou shalt be the woman to bear the tribes that he is appointed to beget.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Asenath bore him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, during the seven years of plenty, for in the time of famine Joseph refrained from all indulgence in the pleasures of life. They were bred in chastity and fear of God by their father, and they were wise, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and well-instructed in all knowledge and in the affairs of state, so that they became the favorites of the court, and were educated with the royal princes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Before the famine broke over the land, Joseph found an opportunity of rendering the king a great service. He equipped an army of four thousand six hundred men, providing all the soldiers with shields and spears and bucklers and helmets and slings. With this army, and aided by the servants and officers of the king, and by the people of Egypt, he carried on a war with Tarshish in the first year after his appointment as viceroy. The people of Tarshish had invaded the territory of the Ishmaelites, and the latter, few in number at that time, were sore pressed, and applied to the king of Egypt for help against their enemies. At the head of his host of heroes, Joseph marched to the land of Havilah, where he was joined by the Ishmaelites, and with united forces they fought against the people of Tarshish, routed them utterly, settled their land with the Ishmaelites, while the defeated men took refuge with their brethren in Javan. Joseph and his army returned to Egypt, and not a man had they lost.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In a little while Joseph&apos;s prophecy was confirmed: that year and the six following years were years of plenty, as he had foretold. The harvest was so ample that a single ear produced two heaps of grain, and Joseph made circumspect arrangements to provide abundantly for the years of famine. He gathered up all the grain, and in the city situated in the middle of each district he laid up the produce from round about, and had ashes and earth strewn on the garnered food from the very soil on which it had been grown; also he preserved the grain in the ear; all these being precautions taken to guard against rot and mildew. The inhabitants of Egypt also tried, on their own account, to put aside a portion of the superabundant harvest of the seven fruitful years against the need of the future, but when the grievous time of dearth came, and they went to their storehouses to bring forth the treasured grain, behold, it had rotted, and become unfit for food. The famine broke in upon the people with such suddenness that the bread gave out unexpectedly as they sat at their tables, they had not even a bite of bran bread.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Thus they were driven to apply to Joseph and beseech his help, and he admonished them, saying, &quot;Give up your allegiance to your deceitful idols, and say, Blessed is He who giveth bread unto all flesh.&quot; But they refused to deny their lying gods, and they betook themselves to Pharaoh, only to be told by him, &quot;Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do!&quot; For this Pharaoh was rewarded. God granted him long life and a long reign, until he became arrogant, and well-merited punishment overtook him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the Egyptians approached Joseph with the petition for bread, he spoke, saying, &quot;I give no food to the uncircumcised. Go hence, and circumcise yourselves, and then return hither.&quot; They entered the presence of Pharaoh, and complained to him regarding Joseph, but he said as before, &quot;Go unto Joseph!&quot; And they replied, &quot;We come from Joseph, and he hath spoken roughly unto us, saying, Go hence and circumcise yourselves! We warned thee in the beginning that he is a Hebrew, and would treat us in such wise.&quot; Pharaoh said to them: &quot;O ye fools, did he not prophesy through the holy spirit and proclaim to the whole world, that there would come seven years of plenty to be followed by seven years of dearth? Why did you not save the yield of one or two years against the day of your need?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Weeping, they made reply: &quot;The grain that we put aside during the good years hath rotted.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh: &quot;Have ye nothing over of the flour of yesterday?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Egyptians: &quot;The very bread in the basket rotted!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh: &quot;Why?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Egyptians: &quot;Because Joseph willed thus!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh: &quot;O ye fools, if his word hath power over the grain, making it to rot when he desireth it to rot, then also must we die, if so be his wish concerning us. Go, therefore, unto him, and do as he bids you.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yosef was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt; then he left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled through all the land of Egypt. During the seven </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">years of abundance, the earth brought forth heaps of produce. He collected all the food of these seven years in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities — the food grown in the fields outside each city he stored in that city. Yosef stored grain in quantities like the sand on the seashore, so much that they stopped counting, because it was beyond measure.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Two sons were born to Yosef before the year of famine came; Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On bore them to him. Yosef called the firstborn M’nasheh [causing to forget], “Because God has caused me to forget all the troubles I suffered at the hands of my family.” The second he called Efrayim [fruit], “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortune.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> The seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt ended; and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Yosef had said. There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food. When the whole land of Egypt started feeling the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Yosef, and do what he tells you to do.” The famine was over all the earth, but then Yosef opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians, since the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. Moreover all countries came to Egypt to Yosef to buy grain, because the famine was severe throughout the earth.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Ya‘akov saw that there was grain in Egypt; so Ya‘akov said to his sons, “Why are you staring at each other? Look,” he said, “I’ve heard that there’s grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from there, so that we can stay alive and not die!” Thus Yosef’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt, except for Binyamin, Yosef’s brother. Ya‘akov did not send him with his brothers, because he was afraid something might happen to him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The famine, which inflicted hardships first upon the wealthy among the Egyptians, gradually extended its ravages as far as Phoenicia, Arabia, and Palestine. Though the sons of Jacob, being young men, frequented the streets and the highways, yet they were ignorant of what their old home-keeping father Jacob knew, that corn could be procured in Egypt. Jacob even suspected that Joseph was in Egypt. His prophetic spirit, which forsook him during the time of his grief for his son, yet manifested itself now and again in dim visions, and he was resolved to send his sons down into Egypt. There was another reason. Though he was not yet in want, he nevertheless had them go thither for food, because he was averse from arousing the envy of the sons of Esau and Ishmael by his comfortable state. For the same reason, to avoid friction with the surrounding peoples, he bade his sons not appear in public with bread in their hands, or in the accoutrements of war. And as he knew that they were likely to attract attention, on account of their heroic stature and handsome appearance, he cautioned them against going to the city all together through the same gate, or, indeed, showing themselves all together anywhere in public, that the evil eye be not cast upon them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The famine in Canaan inspired Joseph with the hope of seeing his brethren. To make sure of their coming, he issued a decree concerning the purchase of corn in Egypt, as follows: &quot;By order of the king and his deputy, and the princes of the realm, be it enacted that he who desireth to buy grain in Egypt may not send his slave hither to do his bidding, but he must charge his own sons therewith. An Egyptian or a Canaanite that hath bought grain and then selleth it again shall be put to death, for none may buy more than he requireth for the needs of his household. Also, who cometh with two or three beasts of burden, and loads them up with grain, shall be put to death.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At the gates of the city of Egypt, Joseph stationed guards, whose office was to inquire and take down the name of all that should come to buy corn, and also the name of their father and their grandfather, and every evening the list of names thus </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">made was handed to Joseph. These precautions were bound to bring Joseph&apos;s brethren down to Egypt, and also acquaint him with their coming as soon as they entered the land.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On their journey his brethren thought more of Joseph than of their errand. They said to one another: &quot;We know that Joseph was carried down into Egypt, and we will make search for him there, and if we should find him, we will ransom him from his master, and if his master should refuse to sell him, we will use force, though we perish ourselves.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the gates of the city of Egypt, the brethren of Joseph were asked what their names were, and the names of their father and grandfather. The guard on duty happened to be Manasseh, the son of Joseph. The brethren submitted to being questioned, saying &quot;Let us go into the town, and we shall see whether this taking down of our names be a matter of taxes. If it be so, we shall not demur; but if it be something else, we shall see to-morrow what can be done in the case.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On the evening of the day they entered Egypt, Joseph discovered their names in the list, which he was in the habit of examining daily, and he commanded that all stations for the sale of corn be closed, except one only. Furthermore, even at this station no sales were to be negotiated unless the name of the would-be purchaser was first obtained. His brethren, with whose names Joseph furnished the overseer of the place, were to be seized and brought to him as soon as they put in appearance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But the first thought of the brethren was for Joseph, and their first concern, to seek him. For three days they made search for him everywhere, even in the most disreputable quarters of the city. Meantime Joseph was in communication with the overseer of the station kept open for the sale of corn, and, hearing that his brethren had not appeared there, he dispatched some of his servants to look for them, but they found them neither in Mizraim, the city of Egypt, nor in Goshen, nor in Raamses. Thereupon he sent sixteen servants forth to make a house to house search for them in the city, and they discovered the brethren of Joseph in a place of ill-fame and haled them before their master.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the supplies bought in Egypt were eaten up, and the family of Jacob began to suffer with hunger, the little children came to him, and they said, &quot;Give us bread, that we die not of hunger before thee.&quot; The words of the little ones brought scorching tears to the eyes of Jacob, and he summoned his sons and bade them go again down into Egypt and buy food. But Judah spake unto him, &quot;The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying that we should not see his face, except our brother Benjamin be with us, and we cannot appear before him with idle pretexts.&quot; And Jacob said, &quot;Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?&quot; It was the first and only time Jacob indulged in empty talk, and God said, &quot;I made it My business to raise his son to the position of ruler of Egypt, and he complains, and says, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with-me?&quot; And Judah protested against the reproach, that he had initiated the Egyptian viceroy in their family relations, with the words: &quot;Why, he knew the very wood of which our baby coaches are made! Father,&quot; he continued, &quot;if Benjamin goes with us, he may, indeed, be taken from us, but also he may not. This is a doubtful matter, but it is certain that if he does not go with us, we shall all die of hunger. It is better not to concern thyself about what is doubtful, and guide thy actions by what is certain. The king of Egypt is a strong and mighty king, and if we go to him without our brother, we shall all be put to death. Dost thou not know, and hast thou not heard, that this king is very powerful and wise, and there is none like unto him in all the earth? We have seen all the kings of the earth, but none like unto the king of Egypt. One would surely say that among all the kings of the earth there is none greater than Abimelech king of the Philistines, yet the king of Egypt is greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech can hardly be compared with one of his officers. Father, thou hast not seen his palace and his throne, and all his servants standing before him. Thou hast not seen that king upon his throne, in all his magnificence and with his royal insignia, arrayed in his royal robes, with a large golden crown upon his head. Thou hast not seen the honor and the glory that God hath given unto him, for there is none like unto him in all the earth. Father, thou hast not seen the wisdom, the understanding, and the knowledge that God has given in his heart. We heard his sweet voice when he spake unto us. We know not, father, who acquainted him with our names, and all that befell us. He asked also concerning </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">thee, saying, Is your father still alive, and is it well with him? Thou hast not seen the affairs of the government of Egypt regulated by him, for none asketh his lord Pharaoh about them. Thou hast not seen the awe and the fear that he imposes upon all the Egyptians. Even we went out from his presence threatening to do unto Egypt as unto the cities of the Amorites, and exceedingly wroth by reason of all his words that he spake concerning us as spies, yet when we came again before him, his terror fell upon us all, and none of us was able to speak a word to him, great or small. Now, therefore, father, send the lad with us, and we will arise and go down into Egypt, and buy food to eat, that we die not of hunger.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah offered his portion in the world to come as surety for Benjamin, and thus solemnly he promised to bring him back safe and sound, and Jacob granted his request, and permitted Benjamin to go down into Egypt with his other sons. They also carried with them choice presents from their father for the ruler of Egypt, things that arouse wonder outside of Palestine, such as the murex, which is the snail that produces the Tyrian purple, and various kinds of balm, and almond oil, and pistachio oil, and honey as hard as stone. Furthermore, Jacob put double money in their hand to provide against a rise in prices in the meantime. And after all these matters were attended to, he spake to his sons, saying: &quot;Here is money, and here is a present, and also your brother. Is there aught else that you need?&quot; And they replied, Yes, we need this, besides, that thou shouldst intercede for us with God.&quot; Then their father prayed: &quot;O Lord, Thou who at the time of creation didst call Enough! to heaven and earth when they stretched themselves out further and further toward infinity, set a limit to my sufferings, too, say unto them, Enough! God Almighty give you mercy before the ruler of Egypt, that he may release unto you Joseph, Simon, and Benjamin.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This prayer was an intercession, not only for the sons of Jacob, but also for their descendants--that God would deliver the Ten Tribes in time to come, as He delivered the two, Judah and Benjamin, and after He permitted the destruction of two Temples, He would grant endless continuance to the third.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Jacob also put a letter addressed to the viceroy of Egypt into the hands of his son. The letter ran thus: &quot;From thy servant Jacob, the son of Isaac, the grandson of Abraham, prince of God, to the mighty and wise king Zaphenathpaneah, the ruler of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Egypt, peace! I make known unto my lord the king that the famine is sore with us in the land of Canaan, and I have therefore sent my sons unto thee, to buy us a little food, that we may live, and not die. My children surrounded me, and begged for something to eat, but, alas, I am very old, and I cannot see with mine eyes, for they are heavy with the weight of years, and also on account of my never-ceasing tears for my son Joseph, who hath been taken from me. I charged my sons not to pass through the gate all together at the same time, when they arrived in the city of Egypt, in consideration of the inhabitants of the land, that they might not take undue notice of them. Also I bade them go up and down in the land of Egypt and seek my son Joseph, mayhap they would find him there.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;This did they do, but thou didst therefore account them as spies. We have heard the report of thy wisdom and sagacity. How, then, canst thou look upon their countenances, and yet declare them to be spies? Especially as we have heard thou didst interpret Pharaoh&apos;s dream, and didst foretell the coming of the famine, are we amazed that thou, in thy discernment, couldst not distinguish whether they be spies or not.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;And, now, O my lord king, I send unto thee my son Benjamin, as thou didst demand of my other sons. I pray thee, take good care of him until thou sendest him back to me in peace with his brethren. Hast thou not heard, and dost thou not know, what our God did unto Pharaoh when he took our mother Sarah unto himself? Or what happened unto Abimelech on account of her? And what our father Abraham did unto the nine kings of Elam, how he killed them and exterminated their armies, though he had but few men with him? Or hast thou not heard what my two sons Simon and Levi did to the eight cities of the Amorites, which they destroyed on account of their sister Dinah? Benjamin consoled them for the loss of Joseph. What, then, will they do unto him that stretcheth forth the hand of power to snatch him away from them?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Knowest thou not, O king of Egypt, that the might of our God is with us, and that He always hearkens unto our prayers, and never forsakes us? Had I called upon God to rise up against thee when my sons told me how thou didst act toward them, thou and thy people, ye all would have been annihilated ere Benjamin could come down to thee. But I reflected that Simon my son was abiding in thy house, and perhaps thou </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">wast doing kindnesses unto him, and therefore I invoked not the punishment of God upon thee. Now my son Benjamin goeth down unto thee with my other sons. Take heed unto thyself, keep thy eyes directed upon him, and God will direct His eye upon all thy kingdom.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;I have said all now that is in my heart. My sons take their youngest brother down into Egypt with them, and do thou send them all back to me in peace.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This letter Jacob put into the keeping of Judah, charging him to deliver it to the ruler of Egypt. His last words to his sons were an admonition to take good care of Benjamin and not leave him out of their sight, either on the journey or after their arrival in Egypt. He bade farewell to them, and then turned in prayer to God, saying: &quot;O Lord of heaven and earth! Remember Thy covenant with our father Abraham. Remember also my father Isaac, and grant grace unto my sons, and deliver them not into the hands of the king of Egypt. O my God, do it for the sake of Thy mercy, redeem my sons and save them from the hands of the Egyptians, and restore their two brethren unto them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Also the women and the children in the house of Jacob prayed to God amid tears, and entreated Him to redeem their husbands and their fathers out of the hands of the king of Egypt.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Great was the joy of Joseph when his brethren stood before him and Benjamin was with them. In his youngest brother he saw the true counterpart of his father. He ordered his son Manasseh, the steward of his house, to bring the men into the palace, and make ready a meal for them. But he was to take care to prepare the meat dishes in the presence of the guests, so that they might see with their own eyes that the cattle had been slaughtered according to the ritual prescriptions, and the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh had been removed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The dinner to which Joseph invited his brethren was a Sabbath meal, for he observed the seventh day even before the revelation of the law. The sons of Jacob refused the invitation of the steward, and a scuffle ensued. While he tried to force them into the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">banqueting hall, they tried to force him out, for they feared it was but a ruse to get possession of them and their asses, on account of the money they had found in their sacks on their return from their first journey to Egypt. In their modesty they put the loss of their beasts upon the same level as the loss of their personal liberty. To the average man property is as precious as life itself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Standing at the door of Joseph&apos;s house, they spake to the steward, and said: &quot;We are in badly reduced circumstances. In our country we supported others, and now we depend upon thee to support us.&quot; After these introductory words, they offered him the money they had found in their sacks. The steward reassured them concerning the money, saying, &quot;However it may be, whether for the sake of your own merits, or for the sake of the merits of your fathers, God hath caused you to find a treasure, for the money ye paid for the corn came into my hand.&quot; Then he brought Simon out to them. Their brother looked like a leather bottle, so fat and rotund had he grown during his sojourn in Egypt. He told his brethren what kind treatment had been accorded unto him. The very moment they left the city he had been released from prison, and thereafter he had been entertained with splendor in the house of the ruler of Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Joseph made his appearance, Judah took Benjamin by the hand, and presented him to the viceroy, and they all bowed down themselves to him to the earth. Joseph asked them concerning the welfare of their father and their grandfather, and they made reply, &quot;Thy servant our father is well; he is yet alive,&quot; and Joseph knew from their words that his grandfather Isaac was no more. He had died at the time when Joseph was released from prison, and the joy of God in the liberation of Joseph was overcast by His sorrow for Isaac. Then Judah handed his father&apos;s letter to Joseph, who was so moved at seeing the well-known handwriting that he had to retire to his chamber and weep. When he came back, he summoned Benjamin to approach close to him, and he laid his hand upon his youngest brother&apos;s head, and blessed him with the words, &quot;God be gracious unto thee, my son.&quot; His father had once mentioned &quot;the children which God hath graciously given Thy servant,&quot; and as Benjamin was not among the children thus spoken of, for he was born later, Joseph compensated him now by blessing him with the grace of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The table was set in three divisions, for Joseph, for his brethren, and for the Egyptians. The sons of Jacob did not venture to eat of the dishes set before them, they were afraid they might not have been prepared according to the ritual prescriptions--a punishment upon Joseph for having slandered his brethren, whom he once charged with not being punctilious in the observance of the dietary laws. The Egyptians, again, could not sit at the same table with the sons of Jacob, because the latter ate the flesh of the animals to which the former paid divine worship.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When all was ready, and the guests were to be seated, Joseph raised his cup, and, pretending to inhale his knowledge from it, he said, &quot;Judah is king, therefore let him sit at the head of the table, and let Reuben the first-born take the second seat,&quot; and thus he assigned places to all his brethren corresponding to their dignity and their age. Moreover, he seated the brothers together who were the sons of the same mother, and when he reached Benjamin, he said, &quot;I know that the youngest among you has no brother borne by his own mother, next to whom he might be seated, and also I have none, therefore he may take his place next to me.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The brethren marvelled one with another at all this. During the meal, Joseph took his portion, and gave it to Benjamin, and his wife Asenath followed his example, and also Ephraim and Manasseh, so that Benjamin had four portions in addition to that which he had received like the other sons of Jacob.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Wine was served at the meal, and it was the first time in twenty-two years that Joseph and his brethren tasted of it, for they had led the life of Nazarites, his brethren because they regretted the evil they had done to Joseph, and Joseph because he grieved over the fate of his father.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph entered into conversation with his brother Benjamin. He asked him whether he had a brother borne by his own mother, and Benjamin answered, &quot;I had one, but I do not know what hath become of him.&quot; Joseph continued his questions: &quot;Hast thou a wife?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Benjamin: &quot;Yes, I have a wife and ten sons.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;And what are their names? &quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Benjamin: &quot;Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Why didst thou give them such peculiar names?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Benjamin: &quot;In memory of my brother and his sufferings: Bela, because my brother disappeared among the peoples; Becher, he was the first-born son of my mother; Ashbel, he was taken away from my father; Gera, he dwells a stranger in a strange land; Naaman, he was exceedingly lovely; Ehi, he was my only brother by my father and my mother together; Rosh, he was at the head of his brethren; Muppim, he was beautiful in every respect; Huppim, he was slandered; and Ard, because he was as beautiful as a rose.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph ordered his magic astrolabe to be brought to him, whereby he knew all things that happen, and he said unto Benjamin, &quot;I have heard that the Hebrews are acquainted with all wisdom, but dost thou know aught of this?&quot; Benjamin answered, &quot;Thy servant also is skilled in all wisdom, which my father hath taught me.&quot; He then looked upon the astrolabe, and to his great astonishment he discovered by the aid of it that he who was sitting upon the throne before him was his brother Joseph. Noticing Benjamin&apos;s amazement, Joseph asked him, &quot;What hast thou seen, and why art thou astonished?&quot; Benjamin said, &quot;I can see by this that Joseph my brother sitteth here before me upon the throne.&quot; And Joseph said: &quot;I am Joseph thy brother! Reveal not the thing unto our brethren. I will send thee with them when they go away, and I will command them to be brought back again into the city, and I will take thee away from them. If they risk their lives and fight for thee, then shall I know that they have repented of what they did unto me, and I will make myself known unto them. But if they forsake thee, I will keep thee, that thou shouldst remain with me. They shall go away, and I will not make myself known unto them.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Joseph inquired of Benjamin what his brethren had told their father after they had sold him into slavery, and he heard the story of the coat dipped in the blood of a kid of the goats. &quot;Yes, brother,&quot; spoke Joseph, &quot;when they had stripped me of my coat, they handed me over to the Ishmaelites, who tied an apron around my waist, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">scourged me, and bade me run off. But a lion attacked the one that beat me, and killed him, and his companions were alarmed, and they sold me to other people.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Dismissed by Joseph with kind words, his brethren started on their homeward journey as soon as the morning was light, for it is a good rule to &quot;leave a city after sunrise, and enter a city before sundown.&quot; Besides, Joseph had a specific reason for not letting his brethren depart from the city during the night. He feared an encounter between them and his servants, and that his men might get the worst of it, for the sons of Jacob were like the wild beasts, which have the upper hand at night.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_zg0fje5zbdar"/>Haggada - The Thief Caught</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They were not yet far beyond the city gates, when Joseph dispatched Manasseh, the steward of his house, to follow after them, and look for the silver cup that he had concealed in Benjamin&apos;s sack. He knew his brethren well, he did not venture to let them get too far from the city before he should attempt to force their return. He hoped that the nearness of the city would intimidate them and make them heed his commands. Manasseh therefore received the order to bring them to a halt, by mild speech if he could, or by rough speech if he must, and carry them back to the city. He acted according to his instructions. When the brethren heard the accusation of theft , they said: &quot;With whomsoever of thy servants the cup be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord&apos;s bondmen.&quot; And Manasseh said, &quot;As you say, so were it proper to do, for if ten persons are charged with theft, and the stolen object is found with one of them, all are held responsible. But I will not be so hard. He with whom the cup is found shall be the bondman, and the rest shall be blameless.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He searched all the sacks, and in order not to excite the suspicion that he knew where the cup was, he began at Reuben, the eldest, and left off at Benjamin, the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin&apos;s sack. In a rage, his brethren shouted at Benjamin, &quot;O thou thief and son of a thief! Thy mother brought shame upon our father by her thievery, and now thou bringest shame upon us.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Is this matter as evil as the matter of the kid of the goats--as the deed of the brethren that sold their own brother into slavery?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>In their fury and vexation, the brethren rent their clothes. God paid them in their own coin. They had caused Jacob to tear his clothes in his grief over Joseph, and now they were made to do the same on account of their own troubles. And as they rent their clothes for the sake of their brother Benjamin, so Mordecai, the descendant of Benjamin, was destined to rend his on account of his brethren, the people of Israel. But because mortification was inflicted upon the brethren through Manasseh, the steward of Joseph, the allotment of territory given to the tribe of Manasseh was &quot;torn&quot; in two, one-half of the tribe had to live on one side of the Jordan, the other half on the other side. And Joseph, who had not shrunk from vexing his brethren so bitterly that they rent their clothes in their abasement, was punished, in that his descendant Joshua was driven to such despair after the defeat of Ai that he, too, rent his clothes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Convicted of theft beyond the peradventure of a doubt, the brethren of Joseph had no choice but to comply with the steward&apos;s command and return to the city. They accompanied him without delay. Each of them loaded his ass himself, raising the burden with one hand from the ground to the back of the beast, and then they retraced their steps cityward, and as they walked, they rapped Benjamin roughly on the shoulder, saying, &quot;O thou thief and son of a thief, thou hast brought the same shame upon us that thy mother brought upon our father.&quot; Benjamin bore the blows and the abusive words in patient silence, and he was rewarded for his humility. For submitting to the blows upon his shoulder, God appointed that His Shekinah should &quot;dwell between his shoulders,&quot; and He also called him &quot;the beloved of the Lord.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph&apos;s brethren returned to the city without fear. Though it was a great metropolis, in their eyes it appeared but as a hamlet of ten persons, which they could wipe out with a turn of the hand. They were led into the presence of Joseph, who, contrary to his usual habit, was not holding a session of the court in the forum on that day. He remained at home, that his brethren might not be exposed to shame in public. They fell to the earth before him, and thus came true his dream of the eleven stars that made obeisance to him. But even while paying homage to Joseph, Judah was boiling inwardly with suppressed rage, and he said to his brethren, &quot;Verily, this man hath forced me to come back hither only that I should destroy the city on this day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Guarded by his valiant men on the right and on the left, Joseph addressed his brethren, snarling, &quot;What deed is this that ye have done, to steal away my cup? I know well, ye took it in order to discover with its help the whereabouts of your brother that hath disappeared.&quot; Judah was spokesman, and he replied: &quot;What shall we say unto my lord concerning the first money that he found in the mouth of our sacks? What shall we speak concerning the second money that also was in our sacks? And how shall we clear ourselves concerning the cup? We cannot acknowledge ourselves guilty, for we know ourselves to be innocent in all these matters. Yet we cannot avow ourselves innocent, because God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants, like a creditor that goes about and tries to collect a debt owing to him. Two brothers take care not to enter a house of mirth and festivity together, that they be not exposed to the evil eye, but we all were caught together in one place, by reason of the sin which we committed in company.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;But if your punishment is for selling Joseph, why should this brother of yours suffer, the youngest, he that had no part in your crime.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah: &quot;A thief and his companions are taken together.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;If you could prevail upon yourselves to report to your father concerning a brother that had not stolen, and had brought no manner of shame upon you, that a wild beast had torn him, you will easily persuade yourselves to say it concerning a brother that hath stolen, and hath brought shame upon you. Go hence, and tell your father, &apos;The rope follows after the water bucket.&apos; But,&quot; continued Joseph, shaking his purple mantle, &quot;God forbid that I should accuse you all of theft. Only the youth that stole the cup in order to divine his brother&apos;s whereabouts shall remain with me as my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The holy spirit called out, &quot;Great peace have they which love thy law!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The brethren all consented to yield Benjamin to the ruler of Egypt, only Judah demurred, and he cried out, &quot;Now it is all over with peace!&quot; and he prepared to use force, if need be, to rescue Benjamin from slavery.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_m2coyz25akmp"/><text:soft-page-break/>Haggada - Judah Pleads And Threatens</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph dismissed his brethren, and carried Benjamin off by main force, and locked him up in a chamber. But Judah broke the door open and stood before Joseph with his brethren. He determined to use in turn the three means of liberating Benjamin at his disposal. He was prepared to convince Joseph by argument, or move him by entreaties, or resort to force, in order to accomplish his end.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He spake: &quot;Thou doest a wrong unto us. Thou who didst say, &apos;I fear God,&apos; thou showest thyself to be like unto Pharaoh, who hath no fear of God. The judgments which thou dost pronounce are not in accordance with our laws, nor are they in accordance with the laws of the nations. According to our law, a thief must pay double the value of what he hath stolen. Only, if he hath no money, he is sold into slavery, but if he hath the money, he maketh double restitution. And according to the law of the nations, the thief is deprived of all he owns. Do so, but let him go free. If a man buys a slave, and then discovers him to be a thief, the transaction is void. Yet thou desirest to make one a slave whom thou chargest with being a thief. I suspect thee of wanting to keep him in thy power for illicit purposes, and in this lustfulness thou resemblest Pharaoh. Also thou art like Pharaoh in that thou makest a promise and keepest it not. Thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring thy youngest brother down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. Dost thou call this setting thine eyes upon him? If thou didst desire nothing beside a slave, then wouldst thou surely accept our offer to serve thee as bondmen instead of Benjamin. Reuben is older than he, and I exceed him in strength. It cannot but be as I say, thou hast a lustful purpose in mind with our brother.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Therefore let these words of mine which I am about to speak find entrance into thy heart: For the sake of the grandmother of this lad were Pharaoh and his house stricken with sore plagues, because he detained her in his palace a single night against her will. His mother died a premature death, by reason of a curse which his father uttered in inconsiderate haste. Take heed, then, that this man&apos;s curse strike thee not and slay thee. Two of us destroyed the whole of a city on account of one woman, how much more would we do it for the sake of a man, and that man the beloved of the Lord, in whose allotment it is appointed that God shall dwell!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;If I but utter a sound, death-dealing pestilence will stalk through the land as far as No. In this land Pharaoh is the first, and thou art the second after him, but in our land my father is the first, and I am the second. If thou wilt not comply with our demand, I will draw my sword, and hew thee down first, and then Pharaoh.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Judah gave utterance to this threat, Joseph made a sign, and Manasseh stamped his foot on the ground so that the whole palace shook. Judah said, &quot;Only one belonging to our family can stamp thus!&quot; and intimidated by this display of great strength, he moderated his tone and manner. &quot;From the very beginning,&quot; he continued to speak, &quot;thou didst resort to all sorts of pretexts in order to embarrass us. The inhabitants of many countries came down into Egypt to buy corn, but none of them didst thou ask questions about their family relations. In sooth, we did not come hither to seek thy daughter in marriage, or peradventure thou desirest an alliance with our sister? Nevertheless we gave thee an answer unto all thy questions.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph replied: &quot;Verily, thou canst talk glibly! Is there another babbler like thee among thy brethren? Why dost thou speak so much, while thy brethren that are older than thou, Reuben, Simon, and Levi, stand by silent?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah: &quot;None of my brethren has so much at stake as I have, if Benjamin returns not to his father. I was a surety to my father for him, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame forever, in this world and in the world to come.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The other brethren withheld themselves intentionally from taking part in the dispute between Judah and Joseph, saying, &quot;Kings are carrying on a dispute, and it is not seemly for us to interfere between them.&quot; Even the angels descended from heaven to earth to be spectators of the combat between Joseph the bull and Judah the lion, and they said, &quot;It lies in the natural course of things that the bull should fear the lion, but here the two are engaged in equal, furious combat.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In reply to Judah, when he explained that his great interest in Benjamin&apos;s safety was due to the pledge he had given to his father, Joseph spoke: &quot;Why wast thou not a surety for thy other brother, when ye sold him for twenty pieces of silver? Then thou didst not regard the sorrow thou wast inflicting upon thy father, but thou didst say, A </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">wild beast hath devoured Joseph. And yet Joseph had done no evil, while this Benjamin has committed theft. Therefore, go up and say unto thy father, The rope hath followed after the water bucket.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These words had such an effect upon Judah that he broke out in sobs, and cried aloud, &quot;How shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?&quot; His outcry reached to a distance of four hundred parasangs, and when Hushim the son of Dan heard it in Canaan, he jumped into Egypt with a single leap and joined his voice with Judah&apos;s, and the whole land was on the point of collapsing from the great noise they produced. Joseph&apos;s valiant men lost their teeth, and the cities of Pithom and Raamses were destroyed, and they remained in ruins until the Israelites built them up again under taskmasters. Also Judah&apos;s brethren, who had kept quiet up to that moment, fell into a rage, and stamped on the ground with their feet until it looked as though deep furrows had been torn in it by a ploughshare. And Judah addressed his brethren, &quot;Be brave, demean yourselves as men, and let each one of you show his heroism, for the circumstances demand that we do our best.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then they resolved to destroy Mizraim, the city of Egypt, and Judah said, &quot;I will raise my voice, and with it destroy Egypt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Reuben: &quot;I will raise my arm, and crush it out of existence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Simon: &quot;I will raise my hand, and lay waste its palaces.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Levi: &quot;I will draw my sword, and slay the inhabitants of Egypt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Issachar: &quot;I will make the land like unto Sodom.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zebulon: &quot;Like unto Gomorrah will I render it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Dan: &quot;I will reduce it to a desert.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Judah&apos;s towering rage began to show signs of breaking out: his right eye shed tears of blood; the hair above his heart grew so stiff that it pierced and rent the five garments in which he was clothed; and he took brass rods, bit them with his teeth, and spat them out as fine powder. When Joseph observed these signs, fear befell him, and in order to show that he, too, was a man of extraordinary strength, he </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">pushed with his foot against the marble pedestal upon which he sat, and it broke into splinters. Judah exclaimed, &quot;This one is a hero equal to myself!&quot; Then he tried to draw his sword from its scabbard in order to slay Joseph, but the weapon could not be made to budge, and Judah was convinced thereby that his adversary was a God-fearing man, and he addressed himself to the task of begging him to let Benjamin go free, but he remained inexorable.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah then said: &quot;What shall we say unto our father, when he seeth that our brother is not with us, and he will grieve over him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Say that the rope hath followed after the water bucket.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah: &quot;Thou art a king, why dost thou speak in this wise, counselling a falsehood? Woe unto the king that is like thee!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Is there a greater falsehood than that ye spake concerning your brother Joseph, whom you sold to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver, telling your father, An evil beast bath devoured him?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah: &quot;The fire of Shechem burneth in my heart, now will I burn all thy land with fire.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Surely, the fire kindled to burn Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, who did kill thy sons, will extinguish the fire of Shechem.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah: &quot;If I pluck out a single hair from my body, I will fill the whole of Egypt with its blood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Such is it your custom to do; thus ye did unto your brother whom you sold, and then you dipped his coat in blood, brought it to your father, and said, An evil beast hath devoured him, and here is his blood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Judah heard this, he was exceedingly wroth, and he took a stone weighing four hundred shekels that was before him, cast it toward heaven with one hand, caught it with his left hand, then sat upon it, and the stone turned into dust. At the command of Joseph, Manasseh did likewise with another stone, and Joseph said to Judah: </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Strength hath not been given to you alone, we also are powerful men. Why, then, will ye all boast before us?&quot; Then Judah sent Naphtali forth, saying, &quot;Go and count all the streets of the city of Egypt and come and tell me the number,&quot; but Simon interposed, saying, &quot;Let not this thing trouble you, I will go to the mount, and take up one huge stone from the mount, throw it over the whole of Mizraim, the city of Egypt, and kill all therein.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Hearing all these words, which they spake aloud, because they did not know that he understood Hebrew, Joseph bade his son Manasseh make haste and gather together all the inhabitants of Egypt, and all the valiant men, and let them come to him on horseback and afoot. Meantime Naphtali had gone quickly to execute Judah&apos;s bidding, for he was as swift as the nimble hart, he could run across a field of corn without breaking an ear. And he returned and reported that the city of Egypt was divided into twelve quarters. Judah bade his brethren destroy the city; he himself undertook to raze three quarters, and he assigned the nine remaining quarters to the others, one quarter to each.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the meantime Manasseh had assembled a great army, five hundred mounted men and ten thousand on foot, among them four hundred valiant heroes, who could fight without spear or sword, using only their strong, unarmed hands. To inspire his brethren with more terror, Joseph ordered them to make a loud noise with all sorts of instruments, and their appearance and the hubbub they produced did, indeed, cause fear to fall upon some of the brethren of Joseph. Judah, however, called to them, &quot;Why are you terrified, seeing that God grants us His mercy?&quot; He drew his sword, and uttered a wild cry, which threw all the people into consternation, and in their disordered flight many fell over each other and perished, and Judah and his brethren followed after the fleeing people as far as the house of Pharaoh. Returning to Joseph, Judah again broke out in loud roars, and the reverberations caused by his cries were so mighty that all the city walls in Egypt and in Goshen fell in ruins, the pregnant women brought forth untimely births, and Pharaoh was flung from his throne. Judah&apos;s cries were heard at a great distance, as far off as Succoth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Pharaoh learnt the reason of the mighty uproar, he sent word to Joseph that he would have to concede the demands of the Hebrews, else the land would suffer </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">destruction. &quot;Thou canst take thy choice,&quot; were the words of Pharaoh, &quot;between me and the Hebrews, between Egypt and the land of the Hebrews. If thou wilt not heed my command, then leave me and go with them into their land.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_9p09chawmhy9"/>Haggada - Joseph Makes Himself Known</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing that his brethren were, indeed, on the point of destroying Egypt, Joseph resolved to make himself known to them, and he cast around for a proper opening, which would lead naturally to his announcement. At his behest, Manasseh laid his hand upon Judah&apos;s shoulder, and his touch allayed Judah&apos;s fury, for he noticed that he was in contact with a kinsman of his, because such strength existed in no other family. Then Joseph addressed Judah gently, saying: &quot;I should like to know who advised him to steal the cup. Could it have been one of you?&quot; Benjamin replied: &quot;Neither did they counsel theft, nor did I touch the cup.&quot; &quot;Take an oath upon it,&quot; demanded Joseph, and Benjamin complied with his brother&apos;s request: &quot;I swear that I did not touch the cup! As true as my brother Joseph is separated from me; as true as I had nothing to do with the darts that my brethren threw at him; as true as I was not one of those to take off his coat; as true as I had no part in the transaction by which he was given over to the Ishmaelites; as true as I did not help the others dip his coat in blood; so true is my oath, that they did not counsel theft, and that I did not commit theft.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;How can I know that this oath of thine taken upon thy brother&apos;s fate is true?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Benjamin: &quot;From the names of my ten sons, which I gave them in memory of my brother&apos;s life and trials, thou canst see how dearly I loved him. I pray thee, therefore, do not bring down my father with sorrow to the grave.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Hearing these words of abiding love, Joseph could refrain himself no longer. He could not but make himself known unto his brethren. He spake these words to them: &quot;Ye said the brother of this lad was dead. Did you yourselves see him dead before you?&quot; They answered, &quot;Yes!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph: &quot;Did you stand beside his grave?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The brethren: &quot;Yes!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Joseph: &quot;Did you throw clods of earth upon his corpse?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The brethren: &quot;No.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Joseph reflected, saying to himself: &quot;My brethren are as pious as aforetime, and they speak no lies. They said I was dead, because when they abandoned me, I was poor, and &apos;a poor man is like unto a dead man;&apos; they stood beside my grave, that is the pit into which they cast me; but they did not say that they had shovelled earth upon me, for that would have been a falsehood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Turning to his brethren, he said: &quot;Ye lie when ye say that your brother is dead. He is not dead. You sold him, and I did buy him. I shall call him, and set him before your eyes,&quot; and he began to call, &quot;Joseph, son of Jacob, come hither! Joseph, son of Jacob, come hither! Speak to thy brethren who did sell thee.&quot; The others turned their eyes hither and thither, to the four corners of the house, until Joseph called to them: &quot;Why look ye here and there? Behold, I am Joseph your brother! &quot;Their souls fled away from them, and they could make no answer, but God permitted a miracle to happen, and their souls came back to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph continued, &quot;Ye see it with your own eyes, and also my brother Benjamin seeth it with his eyes, that I speak with you in Hebrew, and I am truly your brother.&quot; But they would not believe him. Not only had he been transformed from a smooth-faced youth into a bearded man since they had abandoned him, but also the forsaken youth now stood before them the ruler of Egypt. Therefore Joseph bared his body and showed them that he belonged to the descendants of Abraham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Abashed they stood there, and in their rage they desired to slay Joseph as the author of their shame and their suffering. But an angel appeared and flung them to the four corners of the house. Judah raised so loud an outcry that the walls of the city of Egypt tumbled down, the women brought forth untimely births, Joseph and Pharaoh both rolled down off their thrones, and Joseph&apos;s three hundred heroes lost their teeth, and their heads remained forever immobile, facing backward, as they had turned them to discover the cause of the tumult. Yet the brethren did not venture to approach close to Joseph, they were too greatly ashamed of their behavior toward </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">their brother. He sought to calm them, saying, &quot;Now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither, for God did send me before you to preserve life.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Even such kind words of exhortation did not banish their fear, and Joseph continued to speak, &quot;As little as I harbor vengeful thoughts in my heart against Benjamin, so little do I harbor them against you.&quot;And still his brethren were ill at case, and Joseph went on, &quot;Think you that it is possible for me to inflict harm upon you? If the smoke of ten candles could not extinguish one, how can one extinguish ten?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At last the brethren were soothed, and they went up to Joseph, who knew each by name, and, weeping, he embraced and kissed them all in turn. The reason why he wept was that his prophetic spirit showed him the descendants of his brethren enslaved by the nations. Especially did he weep upon Benjamin&apos;s neck, because he foresaw the destruction decreed for the two Temples to be situated in the allotment of Benjamin. And Benjamin also wept upon Joseph&apos;s neck, for the sanctuary at Shiloh, in the territory of Joseph which was likewise doomed to destruction.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh was well pleased with the report of the reconciliation between Joseph and the Hebrews, for he had feared that their dissensions might cause the ruin of Egypt, and he sent his servants to Joseph, that they take part in his joy. Also he sent word to Joseph that it would please him well if his brethren took up their abode in Egypt, and he promised to assign the best parts of the land to them for their dwelling-place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not all the servants of Pharaoh were in agreement with their master concerning this invitation to the Hebrews. Many among them were disquieted, saying, &quot;If one of the sons of Jacob came hither, and he was advanced to a high position over our heads, what evil will happen to us when ten more come hither?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joseph gave all his brethren two changes of raiment, one for use on the ordinary days of the week and one for use on the Sabbath, for, when the cup was found with Benjamin, they had rent their clothes, and Joseph would not have his brethren go about in torn garments. But to Benjamin he gave five changes of raiment, though not in order to distinguish him above his brethren. Joseph remembered only too well what mischief his father had caused by giving him the coat of many colors, thereby </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">arousing the envy of his brethren. He desired only to intimate that Mordecai, a descendant of Benjamin, would once be arrayed in five royal garments.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph presented his brethren, apparelled in their gold and silver embroidered clothes, before Pharaoh, who was well pleased to become acquainted with them when he saw that they were men of heroic stature and handsome appearance. He gave them wagons, to bring their families down into Egypt, but as they were ornamented with images of idols, Judah burnt them, and Joseph replaced them with eleven other wagons, among them the one he had ridden in at his accession to office, to view the land of Egypt. This was to be used by his father on his journey to Egypt. For each of his brothers&apos; children, he sent raiments, and also one hundred pieces of silver for each, but for each of the children of Benjamin he sent ten changes of raiment. And for the wives of his brethren he gave them rich garments of state, such as were worn by the wives of the Pharaohs, and also ointments and aromatic spices. To his sister Dinah he sent silver and gold embroidered clothes, and myrrh, aloes, and other perfumes, and such presents he gave also to the wife and the daughters-in-law of Benjamin. For themselves and for their wives the brethren received all sorts of precious stones and jewelled ornaments, like those that are worn by the Egyptian nobility.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph accompanied his eleven brethren to the frontier, and there he took leave of them with the wish that they and all their families come down to Egypt, and he enjoined upon them, besides, three maxims to be observed by travellers: Do not take too large steps; do not discuss Halakic subjects, that you lose not your way; and enter the city at the latest with the going down of the sun.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sons of Isra’el came to buy along with the others that came, since the famine extended to the land of Kena‘an. Yosef was governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Now when Yosef’s brothers came and prostrated themselves before him on the ground, Yosef saw his brothers and recognized them; but he acted toward them as if he were a stranger and spoke harshly with them. He asked them, “Where are you from?” They answered, “From the land of Kena‘an to buy food.” So Yosef recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Remembering the dreams he had had about them, Yosef said to them, “You are spies! You’ve come to spot our country’s weaknesses!” “No, my lord,” they replied, “your servants have come to buy food. We’re all the sons of one man, we’re upright men; your servants aren’t spies.” “No,” he said to them, “you’ve come to spy out our country’s weaknesses.” They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Kena‘an; the youngest stayed with our father, and another one is gone.” “Just as I said,” replied Yosef, “you’re spies! Here’s how you can prove you’re not lying: as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave here unless your youngest brother comes here. Send one of you, and let him bring your brother. Meanwhile, you will be kept in custody. This will prove whether there is any truth in what you say. Otherwise, as Pharaoh lives, you are certainly spies.” Then he put all of them together in prison for three days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">On the third day, Yosef said to them, “Do what I say, and stay alive, for I fear God. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> If you are upright men, let one of your brothers remain incarcerated in the prison you’re being kept in, while you go and carry grain back to relieve the famine in your homes. But bring your youngest brother to me. In this way your statements will be verified, and you won’t die.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">So they did it. They said to each other, “We are in fact guilty concerning our brother. He was in distress and pleaded with us; we saw it and wouldn’t listen. That’s why this distress has come upon us now.” Re’uven answered them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t wrong the boy’? But you wouldn’t hear of it. Now comes the reckoning for his blood!” They had no idea that Yosef understood them, since an interpreter was translating for them. Yosef turned away from them and wept; then he returned and spoke to them. He took Shim‘on from among them and put him in prison before their eyes. Next he ordered that their containers be filled with grain, that every man’s money be put back in his pack and that they be given provisions for the journey. When these things had been done for them, they loaded their grain on their donkeys and departed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But at camp that night, as one of them opened his pack to give fodder to his donkey, he noticed his money — there it was, just inside his pack. He said to his brothers, “My money has been restored — there it is, right in my pack!” At that, their hearts sank; </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">they turned, trembling, to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They returned to Ya‘akov their father in the land of Kena‘an and told him all that had happened to them. “The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us. He took us for spies in his country. We said to him, ‘We are upright men, we’re not spies; we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is gone, and the youngest stayed with our father in the land of Kena‘an.’ But the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘Here is how I will know that you are upright men: leave one of your brothers with me, take grain to relieve the famine in your homes, and go on your way; but bring your youngest brother to me. By this I will know that you aren’t spies, but are upright men; then I will return your brother to you; and you will do business in the land.’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Next, as they emptied their packs, there was each man’s bag of money in his pack; and when they and their father saw their bags of money, they became afraid. Ya‘akov their father said to them, “You have robbed me of my children! Yosef is gone, Shim‘on is gone, now you’re taking Binyamin away — it all falls on me!” Re’uven said to his father, “If I don’t bring him back to you, you can kill my own two sons! Put him in my care; I will return him to you.” But he replied, “My son will not go down with you. His brother is dead, and he alone is left. If anything were to happen to him while traveling with you, you would bring my gray hair down to Sh’ol with grief.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_hr0kdeyxqw4d"/>Genesis 43</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But the famine was severe in the land; so when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” Y’hudah said to him, “The man expressly warned us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food; but if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’” Isra’el said, “Why did you bring such trouble my way by telling the man you had another brother?” They answered, “The man kept questioning us about ourselves and about our kinsmen. He asked, ‘Is your father still alive?’ ‘Do you have another brother?’ and we answered according to the literal meaning of his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Y’hudah said to Isra’el his father, “Send the boy with me; and we will make preparations and leave; so that we may stay alive and not die, both we and you, and also our little ones. I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me responsible. If I fail to bring him to you and present him to your face, let me bear the blame forever. Except for our lengthy delay, we would have been there again by now.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Their father Isra’el answered them, “If that’s how it is, do this: take in your containers some of the land’s best products, and bring the man a gift — some healing resin, a little honey, aromatic gum, opium, pistachio nuts and almonds. Take twice the amount of money with you; and return the money that came back with you in your packs — it could have been an oversight. Yes, and take your brother too; and get ready; and go again to the man. May </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">El Shaddai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> give you favor in the man’s sight, so that he will release to you your other brother as well as Binyamin. As for me, if I must lose my children, lose them I will.” The men took that gift, and they took twice the money with them, and Binyamin; then they prepared, went down to Egypt and stood before Yosef.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> When Yosef saw Binyamin with them, he said to his household manager, “Take the men inside the house, kill the animals and prepare the meat. These men will dine </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">with me at noon.” The man did as Yosef ordered and brought the men into Yosef’s house.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Upon being ushered inside Yosef’s house, the men became fearful. They said, “It’s because of the money that was returned in our packs the first time that we have been brought inside — so that he can use it as an excuse to attack us, take us as slaves and seize our donkeys too.” So they approached the manager of Yosef’s household and spoke to him at the entrance of the house: “Please, my lord, the first time we indeed came down to buy food; but when we got to camp, we opened our packs, and there inside our packs was each man’s money, the full amount. We have brought it back with us; moreover, we have brought down other money to buy food. We have no idea who put our money in our packs.” “Stop worrying,” he replied, “don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father put treasure in your packs. As for your money — I was the one who received it.” Then he brought Shim‘on out to them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The man brought the men into Yosef’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he provided fodder for their donkeys. Then they got their gift ready for Yosef’s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were going to eat a meal there. When Yosef arrived home, they went in the house and presented him with the gift they had brought with them, then prostrated themselves before him on the ground. He asked them how they were and inquired, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” They answered, “Your servant our father is well; yes, he is still alive,” as they bowed in respect. He looked up and saw Binyamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” and added, “May God be good to you, my son.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Then Yosef hurried out, because his feelings toward his brother were so strong that he wanted to cry; he went into his bedroom and there he wept. Then he washed his face and came out, but he controlled himself as he gave the order to serve the meal. They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians included at the meal by themselves — Egyptians don’t eat with Hebrews, because that is abhorrent to them. So they sat there facing him, the firstborn in the place of honor, the youngest in last place; and the men expressed their amazement to each </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">other. Each was given his serving there in front of him, but Binyamin’s portion was five times as large as any of theirs. So they drank and enjoyed themselves with him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_yuxiufnzzzvb"/>Genesis 44</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then he ordered the manager of his household, “Fill the men’s packs with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money just inside his pack. And put my goblet, the silver one, just inside the pack of the youngest, along with his grain money.” He did what Yosef told him to do.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At daybreak the men were sent off with their donkeys; but before they were far from the city Yosef said to his manager, “Up, go after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? Isn’t this the goblet my lord drinks from, indeed the one he uses for divination? What you have done is evil!’” So he caught up with them and said these words to them. They replied, “Why does my lord speak this way? Heaven forbid that we should do such a thing! Why, the money we found inside our packs we brought back to you from the land of Kena‘an! So how would we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? Whichever one of us the goblet is found with, let him be put to death — and the rest of us will be my lord’s slaves!” He replied, “Fine; let it be as you have said: whichever one it is found with will be my slave. But the rest of you will be blameless.” Then each hurried to put his pack down on the ground, and each one opened his pack. He searched, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the goblet was found in the pack belonging to Binyamin. At this, they tore their clothes from grief. Then each man loaded up his donkey and returned to the city.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(A: Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Y’hudah and his brothers arrived at Yosef’s house. He was still there, and they fell down before him on the ground. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(S: Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Yosef said to them, “How could you do such a thing? Don’t you know that a man such as myself can learn the truth by divination?” Y’hudah said, “There’s nothing we can say to my lord! How can we speak? There’s no way we can clear ourselves! God has revealed your servants’ guilt; so here we are, my lord’s slaves — both we and also the one in whose possession the cup was found.” But he replied, “Heaven forbid that I should act in such a way. The man in whose possession the goblet was found will be my slave; but as for you, go in peace to your father.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Y’hudah approached Yosef and said, “Please, my lord! Let your servant say something to you privately; and don’t be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father? or a brother?’ We answered my lord, ‘We have a father who is an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one whose brother is dead; so that of his mother’s children he alone is left; and his father loves him.’ But you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, so that I can see him.’ We answered my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father; if he were to leave his father, his father would die.’ You said to your servants, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ We went up to your servant my father and told him what my lord had said; but when our father said, ‘Go again, and buy us some food,’ we answered, ‘We can’t go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go down, because we can’t see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons: the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he has been torn to pieces,” and I haven’t seen him since. Now if you take this one away from me too, and something happens to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sh’ol with grief.’ So now if I go to your servant my father, and the boy isn’t with us — seeing how his heart is bound up with the boy’s heart — </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> when he sees that the boy isn’t with us, he will die; and your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sh’ol with grief. For your servant himself guaranteed his safety; I said, ‘If I fail to bring him to you, then I will bear the blame before my father forever.’ Therefore, I beg you, let your servant stay as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers. For how can I go up to my father if the boy isn’t with me? I couldn’t bear to see my father so overwhelmed by anguish.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_g2yysnmutnjc"/>Genesis 45</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At last Yosef could no longer control his feelings in front of his attendants and cried, “Get everybody away from me!” So no one else was with him when Yosef revealed to his brothers who he was. He wept aloud, and the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard. Yosef said to his brothers, “I am Yosef! Is it true that my father is still alive?” His brothers couldn’t answer him, they were so dumbfounded at seeing him. Yosef said to his brothers, “Please! Come closer.” And they came closer. He said, “I am Yosef, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. But don’t be sad that you sold me into slavery here or angry at yourselves, because it was God who sent me ahead of you to preserve life. The famine has been over the land for the last two years, and for yet another five years there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me ahead of you to ensure that you will have descendants on earth and to save your lives in a great deliverance. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his household and ruler over the whole land of Egypt. Hurry, go up to my father, and tell him, ‘Here is what your son Yosef says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt! Come down to me, don’t delay! You will live in the land of Goshen and be near me — you, your children, your grandchildren, flocks, herds, everything you own. I will provide for you there, so that you won’t become poverty-stricken, you, your household and all that you have; because five years of famine are yet to come.”’ Here! Your own eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Binyamin, that it is my own mouth speaking to you. Tell my father how honored I am in Egypt and everything you have seen, and quickly bring my father down here!” Then he embraced his brother Binyamin and wept, and Binyamin wept on his neck, and he kissed all his brothers and wept on them. After that, his brothers talked with him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The report of this reached Pharaoh’s house: “Yosef’s brothers have come”; and Pharaoh and his servants were pleased. Pharaoh said to Yosef, “Tell your brothers, ‘Here is what you are to do. Load up your animals, go to the land of Kena‘an, take your father and your families, and come back to me. I will give you good property in Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iv)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> “‘Moreover — and this is an order — do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt to carry your little ones and your wives, and bring your father, and come. Don’t worry about your stuff, because everything good in the land of Egypt is yours.’”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sons of Isra’el acted accordingly; and Yosef gave them wagons, as Pharaoh had ordered, and gave them provisions for their journey. To each of them he gave a set of new clothes; but to Binyamin he gave seven-and-a-half pounds of silver and five sets of new clothes. Likewise, to his father he sent ten donkeys loaded with the finest goods Egypt produced, as well as ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread and food for his father to eat on the return journey. Thus he sent his brothers on their way, and they left; he said to them, “Don’t quarrel among yourselves while you’re traveling!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">So they went up out of Egypt, entered the land of Kena‘an and came to Ya‘akov their father. They told him, “Yosef is still alive! He is ruler over the whole land of Egypt!” He was stunned at the news; he couldn’t believe them. So they reported to him everything Yosef had said to them; but it was only when he saw the wagons which Yosef had sent to carry him that the spirit of Ya‘akov their father began to revive. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(v)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Isra’el said, “Enough! My son Yosef is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_6r1899xs0rmk"/>Genesis 46</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Isra’el took everything he owned with him on his journey. He arrived at Be’er-Sheva and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Yitz’chak. In a vision at night God called to Isra’el, “Ya‘akov! Ya‘akov!” He answered, “Here I am.” He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt. It is there that I will make you into a great nation. Not only will I go down with you to Egypt; but I will also bring you back here again, after Yosef has closed your eyes.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">So Ya‘akov left Be’er-Sheva; the sons of Isra’el brought Ya‘akov their father, their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry them. They took their cattle and their possessions which they had acquired in the land of Kena‘an and arrived in Egypt, Ya‘akov and all his descendants with him — his sons, grandsons, daughters, granddaughters and all his descendants he brought with him into Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These are the names of Isra’el’s children who came into Egypt, Ya‘akov and his sons: Re’uven Ya‘akov’s firstborn; and the sons of Re’uven — Hanokh, Pallu, Hetzron and Karmi.</text:p>

The sons of Yosef, born to him in Egypt, were two in number. Thus all the people in Ya‘akov’s family who entered Egypt numbered seventy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vi)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Ya‘akov sent Y’hudah ahead of him to Yosef, so that the latter might guide him on the road to Goshen; thus they arrived in the land of Goshen. Yosef prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet Isra’el his father. He presented himself to him, embraced him and wept on his neck for a long time. Then Isra’el said to Yosef, “Now I can die, because I have seen your face and seen that you are still alive.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yosef said to his brothers and his father’s family, “I’m going up to tell Pharaoh. I’ll say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s family, who were in the land of Kena‘an, have come to me. The men are shepherds and keepers of livestock; they have brought </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">their flocks, their herds and all their possessions.’ Now when Pharaoh summons you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ tell him, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we and our ancestors.’ This will ensure that you will live in the land of Goshen — for any shepherd is abhorrent to the Egyptians.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_19zpy8as3qc"/>Genesis 47</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Yosef went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers have come from the land of Kena‘an with their flocks, livestock and all their possessions; right now they are in the land of Goshen.” He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They answered Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors,” and added, “We have come to live in the land, because in the land of Kena‘an there is no place to pasture your servant’s flocks, the famine is so severe there. Therefore, please, let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” Pharaoh said to Yosef, “Your father and brothers have come to you, and the land of Egypt lies before you. Have your father and brothers live on the best property in the country — let them live in the land of Goshen. Moreover, if you know that some of them are particularly competent, put them in charge of my livestock.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yosef then brought in Ya‘akov his father and presented him to Pharaoh, and Ya‘akov blessed Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Ya‘akov, “How old are you?” and Ya‘akov replied, “The time of my stay on earth has been 130 years; they have been few and difficult, fewer than the years my ancestors lived.” Then Ya‘akov blessed Pharaoh and left his presence.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Yosef found a place for his father and brothers and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best region of the country, in the land of Ra‘amses, as Pharaoh had ordered. Yosef provided food for his father, his brothers and all his father’s household, taking full care of even the youngest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">There was no food anywhere, for the famine was very severe, so that both Egypt and Kena‘an grew weak from hunger. Yosef collected all the money there was in Egypt and Kena‘an in exchange for the grain they bought, and put the money in Pharaoh’s treasury. When all the money in Egypt had been spent, and likewise in Kena‘an, all the Egyptians approached Yosef and said, “Give us something to eat, even though we have no money; why should we die before your eyes?” Yosef replied, “Give me your livestock. If you don’t have money, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.” So they brought Yosef their livestock; and Yosef gave them food in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">exchange for the horses, flocks, cattle and donkeys — all that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When that year was over, they approached Yosef again and said to him, “We won’t hide from my lord that all our money is spent, and the herds of livestock belong to my lord. We have nothing left, as my lord can see, but our bodies and our land. Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be enslaved to Pharaoh. But also give us seed to plant, so that we can stay alive and not die, and so that the land won’t become barren.” So Yosef acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, as one by one the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine weighed on them so severely. Thus the land became the property of Pharaoh. As for the people, he reduced them to serfdom city by city, from one end of Egypt’s territory to the other. Only the priests’ land did he not acquire, because the priests were entitled to provisions from Pharaoh, and they ate from what Pharaoh provided them; therefore they did not sell their land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Yosef said to the people, “As of today I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you to sow the land. When harvest time comes, you are to give twenty percent to Pharaoh; eighty percent will be yours to keep for seed to plant in the fields, as well as for your food and for that of your households and your little ones.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> They replied, “You have saved our lives! So if it pleases my lord, we will be Pharaoh’s slaves.” Yosef made it a law for the country of Egypt, valid to this day, that Pharaoh should have twenty percent. Only the property belonging to the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Isra’el lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. They acquired possessions in it and were productive, and their numbers multiplied greatly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ya‘akov lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; thus Ya‘akov lived to be 147 years old. The time came when Isra’el was approaching death; so he called for his son Yosef and said to him, “If you truly love me, please put your hand under my thigh and pledge that, out of consideration for me, you will not bury me in Egypt. Rather, when I sleep with my fathers, you are to carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">buried.” He replied, “I will do as you have said.” He said, “Swear it to me,” and he swore to him. Then Isra’el bowed down at the head of his bed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_l5pvw6ogsa02"/>Genesis 48</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Awhile later someone told Yosef that his father was ill. He took with him his two sons, M’nasheh and Efrayim. Ya‘akov was told, “Here comes your son Yosef.” Isra’el gathered his strength and sat up in bed. Ya‘akov said to Yosef, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">El Shaddai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> appeared to me at Luz in the land of Kena‘an and blessed me, saying to me, ‘I will make you fruitful and numerous. I will make of you a group of peoples; and I will give this land to your descendants to possess forever.’ Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Efrayim and M’nasheh will be as much mine as Re’uven and Shim‘on are. The children born to you after them will be yours, but for purposes of inheritance they are to be counted with their older brothers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died suddenly, as we were traveling through the land of Kena‘an, while we were still some distance from Efrat; so I buried her there on the way to Efrat (also known as Beit-Lechem).”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Isra’el noticed Yosef’s sons and asked, “Whose are these?” Yosef answered his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” Ya‘akov replied, “I want you to bring them here to me, so that I can bless them.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Now Isra’el’s eyes were dim with age, so that he could not see. Yosef brought his sons near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. Isra’el said to Yosef, “I never expected to see even you again, but God has allowed me to see your children too!” Yosef brought them out from between his legs and prostrated himself on the ground. Then Yosef took them both, Efrayim in his right hand toward Isra’el’s left hand and M’nasheh in his left hand toward Isra’el’s right hand, and brought them near to him. But Isra’el put out his right hand and laid it on the head of the younger one, Efrayim, and put his left hand on the head of M’nasheh — he intentionally crossed his hands, even though M’nasheh was the firstborn. Then he blessed Yosef: “The God in whose presence my fathers Avraham and Yitz’chak lived, the God who has been my own shepherd all my life long to this day, the angel who has rescued me from all harm, bless these boys. May they remember who I am and what I stand for, and likewise my fathers Avraham and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yitz’chak, who they were and what they stood for. And may they grow into teeming multitudes on the earth.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> When Yosef saw that his father was laying his right hand on Efrayim’s head, it displeased him, and he lifted up his father’s hand to remove it from Efrayim’s head and place it instead on M’nasheh’s head. Yosef said to his father, “Don’t do it that way, my father; for this one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.” But his father refused and said, “I know that, my son, I know it. He too will become a people, and he too will be great; nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will grow into many nations.” Then he added this blessing on them that day: “Isra’el will speak of you in their own blessings by saying, ‘May God make you like Efrayim and M’nasheh.’” Thus he put Efrayim ahead of M’nasheh.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Isra’el then said to Yosef, “You see that I am dying, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors. Moreover, I am giving to you a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">sh’khem</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> [shoulder, ridge, share, city of Sh’khem] more than to your brothers; I captured it from the Emori with my sword and bow.”</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When they arrived at the threshing-floor in Atad, beyond the Yarden, they raised a loud and bitter lamentation, mourning for his father seven days.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Realizing that their father was dead, Yosef’s brothers said, “Yosef may hate us now and pay us back in full for all the suffering we caused him.” So they sent a message </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">to Yosef which said, “Your father gave this order before he died: ‘Say to Yosef, “I beg you now, please forgive your brothers’ crime and wickedness in doing you harm.”’ So now, we beg of you, forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father.” Yosef wept when they spoke to him; and his brothers too came, prostrated themselves before him and said, “Here, we are your slaves.” But Yosef said to them, “Don’t be afraid! Am I in the place of God? You meant to do me harm, but God meant it for good — so that it would come about as it is today, with many people’s lives being saved. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(vii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> So don’t be afraid — I will provide for you and your little ones.” In this way he comforted them, speaking kindly to them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Yosef continued living in Egypt, he and his father’s household. Yosef lived 110 years. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Yosef lived to see Efrayim’s great-grandchildren, and the children of M’nasheh’s son Makhir were born on Yosef’s knees.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yosef said to his brothers, “I am dying. But God will surely remember you and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov.” Then Yosef took an oath from the sons of Isra’el: “God will surely remember you, and you are to carry my bones up from here.” So Yosef died at the age of 110, and they embalmed him and put him in a coffin in Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">JACOB RECEIVES THE GLAD TIDINGS</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In blithe spirits the sons of Jacob journeyed up to the land of Canaan, but when they reached the boundary line, they said to one another, &quot;How shall we do? If we appear before our father and tell him that Joseph is alive, he will be greatly frightened, and he will not be inclined to believe us.&quot; Besides, Joseph&apos;s last injunction to them had been to take heed and not startle their father with the tidings of joy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">On coming close to their habitation, they caught sight of Serah, the daughter of Asher, a very beautiful maiden, and very wise, who was skilled in playing upon the harp. They summoned her unto them and gave her a harp, and bade her play before Jacob and sing that which they should tell her. She sat down before Jacob, and, with </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">an agreeable melody, she sang the following words, accompanying herself upon the harp: &quot;Joseph, my uncle, liveth, he ruleth over the whole of Egypt, he is not dead!&quot; She repeated these words several times, and Jacob grew more and more pleasurably excited. His joy awakened the holy spirit in him, and he knew that she spoke the truth. The spirit of prophecy never visits a seer when he is in a state of lassitude or in a state of grief; it comes only together with joy. All the years of Joseph&apos;s separation from him Jacob had had no prophetic visions, because he was always sad, and only when Serah&apos;s words reawakened the feeling of happiness in his heart, the prophetic spirit again took possession of him. Jacob rewarded her therefor with the words, &quot;My daughter, may death never have power over thee, for thou didst revive my spirit.&quot; And so it was. Serah did not die, she entered Paradise alive. At his bidding, she repeated the words she had sung again and again, and they gave Jacob great joy and delight, so that the holy spirit waxed stronger and stronger within him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While he was sitting thus in converse with Serah, his sons appeared arrayed in all their magnificence, and with all the presents that Joseph had given them, and they spake to Jacob, saying: &quot;Glad tidings! Joseph our brother liveth! He is ruler over the whole land of Egypt, and he sends thee a message of joy.&quot; At first Jacob would not believe them, but when they opened their packs, and showed him the presents Joseph had sent to all, he could not doubt the truth of their words any longer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joseph had had a premonition that his father would refuse to give his brethren credence, because they had tried to deceive him before, and &quot;it is the punishment of the liar that his words are not believed even when he speaks the truth.&quot; He had therefore said to them, &quot;If my father will not believe your words, tell him that when I took leave of him, to see whether it was well with you, he had been teaching me the law of the heifer whose neck is broken in the valley.&quot; When they repeated this, every last vestige of Jacob&apos;s doubt disappeared, and he said: &quot;Great is the steadfastness of my son Joseph. In spite of all his sufferings he has remained constant in his piety. Yea, great are the benefits that the Lord hath conferred upon me. He saved me from the hands of Esau, and from the hands of Laban, and from the Canaanites who </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">pursued after me. I have tasted many joys, and I hope to see more, but never did I hope to set eyes upon Joseph again, and now I shall go down to him and behold him before my death.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Jacob and the members of his family put on the clothes Joseph had sent, among them a turban for Jacob, and they made all preparations to journey down into Egypt and dwell there with Joseph and his family. Hearing of his good fortune, the kings and the grandees of Canaan came to wait upon Jacob and express sympathy with him in his joy, and he prepared a three days&apos; banquet for them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob, however, would not go down into Egypt without first inquiring whether it was the will of God that he should leave the Holy Land. He said, &quot;How can I leave the land of my fathers, the land of my birth, the land in which the Shekinah dwells, and go into an unclean land, inhabited by slaves of the sons of Ham, a land wherein there is no fear of God?&quot; Then he brought sacrifices in honor of God, in the expectation that a Divine vision would descend upon him and instruct him whether to go down into Egypt or have Joseph come up to Canaan. He feared the sojourn in Egypt, for he remembered the vision he had had at Beth-el on leaving his father&apos;s house, and he said to God: &quot;I resemble my father. As he was greedy in filling his maw, so am I, and therefore I would go down into Egypt in consequence of the famine. As my father preferred one son to the other, so had I a favorite son, and therefore I would go down into Egypt to see Joseph. But in this I do not resemble my father, he had only himself to provide for, and my house consists of seventy souls, and therefore am I compelled to go down into Egypt. The blessing which my father gave me was not fulfilled in me, but in my son Joseph, whom peoples serve, and before whom nations bow down.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then the Shekinah addressed Jacob, calling his name twice in token of love, and bidding him not to fear the Egyptian slavery foretold for the descendants of Abraham, for God would have pity upon the suffering of his children and deliver them from bondage. God furthermore said, &quot;I will go down into Egypt with thee,&quot; and the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Shekinah accompanied Jacob thither, bringing the number of the company with which he entered Egypt up to seventy. But as Jacob entertained fears that his descendants would stay there forever, God gave him the assurance that He would lead him forth together with all the pious that were like unto him. And God also told Jacob that Joseph had remained steadfast in his piety even in Egypt, and he might dismiss all doubts from his mind on this score, for it was his anxiety on this account that had induced Jacob to consider going down into Egypt; he wanted only to make sure of Joseph&apos;s faithfulness, and then return home, but God commanded him to go thither and remain there.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Before Jacob left Canaan, he went to Beer-sheba, to hew down the cedars that Abraham had planted there, and take them with him to Egypt. For centuries these cedar trees remained in the possession of his descendants; they carried them with them when they left Egypt, and they used them in building the Tabernacle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Although Joseph had put wagons at the disposal of his brethren for the removal of his family from Canaan to Egypt, they yet carried Jacob upon their arms, for which purpose they divided themselves into three divisions, one division after the other assuming the burden. As a reward for their filial devotion, God redeemed their descendants from Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Judah was sent on ahead by his father, to erect a dwelling in Goshen, and also a Bet ha-Midrash, that Jacob might set about instructing his sons at once after his arrival. He charged Judah with this honorable task in order to compensate him for a wrong he had done him. All the years of Joseph&apos;s absence he had suspected Judah of having made away with Rachel&apos;s son. How little the suspicion was justified he realized now when Judah in particular had been assiduous in securing the safety of Benjamin, the other son of Rachel. Jacob therefore said to Judah: &quot;Thou hast done a pious, God-bidden deed, and hast shown thyself to be a man capable of carrying on negotiations with Joseph. Complete the work thou hast begun! Go to Goshen, and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">together with Joseph prepare all things for our coming. Indeed,&quot; continued Jacob, &quot;thou wast the cause of our going down into Egypt, for it was at thy suggestion that Joseph was sold as a slave, and, also, through thy descendants Israel will be led forth out of Egypt.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Joseph was informed of the approach of his father, he rejoiced exceedingly, chiefly because his coming would stop the talk of the Egyptians, who were constantly referring to him as the slave that had dominion over them. &quot;Now,&quot; thought Joseph, &quot;they will see my father and my brethren, and they will be convinced that I am a free-born man, of noble stock.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In his joy in anticipation of seeing his father, Joseph made ready his chariot with his own hands, without waiting for his servants to minister to him, and this loving action redounded later to the benefit of the Israelites, for it rendered of none effect Pharaoh&apos;s zeal in making ready his chariot himself, with his own hands, to pursue after the Israelites.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">JACOB ARRIVES IN EGYPT</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the Egyptian nobles observed their viceroy completing his preparations to meet his father, they did the same. Indeed, Joseph had issued a proclamation throughout the land, threatening with death all that did not go forth to meet Jacob. The procession that accompanied him was composed of countless men, arrayed in byssus and purple, and marching to the sound of all sorts of musical instruments. Even the women of Egypt had a part in the reception ceremonies. They ascended to the roofs of the houses and the walls of the cities, ready to greet Jacob with the music of cymbals and timbrels.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Joseph wore the royal crown upon his head, Pharaoh had yielded it to him for the occasion. He descended from his chariot when he was at a distance of about fifty ells from his father, and walked the rest of the way on foot, and his example was followed by the princes and nobles of Egypt. When Jacob caught sight of the approaching procession, he was rejoiced, and even before he recognized Joseph, he bowed down before him, but for permitting his father to show him this mark of honor, punishment was visited upon Joseph. He died an untimely death, before the years of life assigned to him had elapsed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">That no harm befall Jacob from a too sudden meeting with him, Joseph sent his oldest son ahead with five horses, the second son following close after him in the same way. As each son approached, Jacob thought he beheld Joseph, and so he was prepared gradually to see him face to face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Meantime Jacob had espied, from where he was seated, a man in royal robes among the Egyptians, a crown upon his head, and a purple mantle over his shoulders, and he asked Judah who it might be. When he was told that it was Joseph, his joy was great over the high dignity attained by his son.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">By this time Joseph had come close to his father, and he bowed himself before him down to the earth, and all the people with him likewise prostrated themselves. Then Joseph fell upon his father&apos;s neck, and he wept bitterly. He was particularly grieved that he had permitted his father to bow down before him but a little while before without hindering it. At the very moment when Joseph embraced his father, Jacob was reciting the Shema&apos;, and he did not allow himself to be interrupted in his prayer, but then he said, &quot;When they brought me the report of the death of Joseph, I thought I was doomed to double death--that I should lose this world and the world to come as well. The Lord had promised to make me the ancestor of twelve tribes, and as the death of my son rendered it impossible that this promise should be realized, I feared I had incurred the doom by my own sins, and as a sinner I could not but expect to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">forfeit the future world, too. But now that I have beheld thee alive, I know that my death will be only for the world here below.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Such was the manner of Jacob&apos;s arrival in Egypt. He came with his whole family, sixty-nine persons they were in all, but the number was raised to seventy by the birth of Jochebed, afterward the mother of Moses, which took place when the cavalcade had advanced to the space between the one and the other city wall. All the males in his family were married men; even Pallu and Hezron, the latter of whom was but one year old at the time of their migration, and the former but two years, had the wives with them that had been chosen for them by their parents. In general, all the sons and grandsons of Jacob had married young, some of them had been fathers at the age of seven.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph took some from among his brethren, and presented them to Pharaoh. He chose the weakest of them, that the king might not be tempted to retain them in his service as warriors. And as he did not desire his family to live at close quarters with the Egyptians and perhaps amalgamate with them, he introduced them as shepherds. The Egyptians worshipped the constellation of the rain, and paid divine honors to animals, and they kept aloof from shepherds. Pharaoh therefore was inclined to grant Joseph&apos;s wish, to give them the pasture land of Goshen for their sojourning place, the land that was theirs by right, for the Pharaoh that took Sarah away from Abraham by force had given it to her as her irrevocable possession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In their conversation with Pharaoh the brethren of Joseph made it plain to the Egyptian king that it was not their intention to remain in Egypt forever, it was to be only a temporary dwelling-place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Then Joseph set Jacob his father before Pharaoh, and when the king saw him, he said to Og, who happened to be with him at that moment, &quot;Seest thou! Thou wast wont to call Abraham a sterile mule, and here is his grandson with a family of seventy persons!&quot; Og would not believe his own eyes, he thought Abraham was standing before him, so close was the resemblance between Jacob and his progenitor. Then Pharaoh asked about Jacob&apos;s age, to find out whether he actually was Jacob, and not Abraham. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, &quot;The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years,&quot; using the word pilgrimage in reference to life on earth, which the pious regard as a temporary sojourn in alien lands. &quot;Few and evil,&quot; he continued, &quot;have been the days of the years of my life. In my youth I had to flee to a strange land on account of my brother Esau, and now, in my old age, I must again go to a strange land, and my days have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.&quot; These words sufficed to convince Pharaoh and Og that the man standing before them was not Abraham, but his grandson.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Jacob uttered the words, &quot;The days of the years of my pilgrimage have been few and evil,&quot; God said to him: &quot;Jacob, I saved thee out of the hands of Esau and Laban, I restored Joseph unto thee, and made him to be a king and a ruler, and yet thou speakest of few and evil days. Because of thy ingratitude, thou wilt not attain unto the days of the years of the life of thy fathers,&quot; and Jacob died at an age thirty-three years less than his father Isaac&apos;s.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On going out from the presence of Pharaoh, Jacob blessed the king with the words, &quot;May the years still in store for me be given unto thee, and may the Nile overflow its banks henceforth again and water the land.&quot; His words were fulfilled. In order to show that the pious are a blessing for the world, God caused the Nile to rise above its bed and fructify the land of Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_cm9k3le2cgso"/><text:soft-page-break/>Haggada - Joseph&apos;s Kindness And Generosity</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob and his family now settled in the land of Goshen, and Joseph provided them with all things needful, not only with food and drink, but also with clothing, and in his love and kindness he entertained his father and his brethren daily at his own table. He banished the wrong done to him by his brethren from his mind, and he besought his father to pray to God for them, that He should forgive their great transgression. Touched by this noble sign of love, Jacob cried out, &quot;O Joseph, my child, thou hast conquered the heart of thy father Jacob.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph had other virtues, besides. The title &quot;the God-fearing one,&quot; borne only by him, Abraham, Job, and Obadiah, he gained by reason of his kindness of heart and his generosity. Whatever he gave his brethren, he gave with a &quot;good eye,&quot; a liberal spirit. If it was bread for food, it was sure to be abundant enough, not only to satisfy the hunger of all, but also for the children to crumble, as is their habit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Joseph was more than a helper to his family. As a shepherd pastures his flock, so he provided for the whole world during the years of famine. The people cursed Pharaoh, who kept the stores of corn in his treasure chambers for his own use, and they blessed Joseph, who took thought for the famishing, and sold grain to all that came. The wealth which he acquired by these sales was lawful gain, for the prices were raised, not by him, but by the Egyptians themselves. One part of his possessions, consisting of gold and silver and precious stones, Joseph buried in four different places, in the desert near the Red Sea, on the banks of the Euphrates, and in two spots in the desert in the vicinity of Persia and Media. Korah discovered one of the hiding-places, and the Roman emperor Antoninus, the son of Severus, another. The other two will never be found, because God has reserved the riches they hold for the pious, to be enjoyed by them in the latter days, the days of the Messiah. The remainder of Joseph&apos;s possessions he gave away, partly to his brethren and their families, and partly to Pharaoh, who put them into his treasury.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The wealth of the whole world flowed into Egypt at that time, and it remained there until the exodus of the Israelites. They took it along, leaving Egypt like a net without fish. The Israelites kept the treasure until the time of Rehoboam, who was deprived of it by the Egyptian king Shishak, and he in turn had to yield it to Zerah, the king of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Ethiopia. Once more it came into possession of the Jews when King Asa conquered Zerah, but this time they held it for only a short while, for Asa surrendered it to the Aramean king Ben-hadad, to induce him to break his league with Baasha, the king of the Ten Tribes. The Ammonites, in turn, captured it from Ben-hadad, only to lose it in their war with the Jews under Jehoshaphat. Again it remained with the Jews, until the time of King Ahaz, who sent it to Sennacherib as tribute money. Hezekiah won it back, but Zedekiah, the last king of the Jews, lost it to the Chaldeans, from whom it came to Persia, thence to the Greeks, and finally to the Romans, and with the last it remained for all time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The people were soon left without means to purchase the corn they needed. In a short time they had to part with their cattle, and when the money thus secured was spent, they sold their land to Joseph, and even their persons. Many of them would cover themselves with clay and appear before Joseph, and say to him, &quot;O lord king, see me and see my possessions!&quot; And so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, and the inhabitants became his tenants, and they gave a fifth of their ingatherings unto joseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The only class of the people permitted to remain in possession of their land were the priests. Joseph owed them gratitude, for they had made it possible for him to become the ruler over Egypt. The Egyptians had hesitated to make him their viceroy, because they shrank from choosing a man accused of adultery for so high an office. It was the priests that made the suggestion to examine Joseph&apos;s torn garment, which his mistress had submitted as evidence of his guilt, and see whether the rent was in front or in back. If it was in back, it would show his innocence--he had turned to flee, and his temptress had clutched him so that the garment tore. But if the tear was in front, then it would be a proof of his guilt--he had used violence with the woman, and she had torn the mantle in her efforts to defend her honor. The angel Gabriel came and transferred the rent from the fore part to the back, and the Egyptians were convinced of Joseph&apos;s innocence, and their scruples about raising him to the kingship were removed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>As soon as the Egyptians learnt of the advantageous position of the priests, they all tried to prove themselves members of the caste. But Joseph investigated the lists in the archives, and determined the estate of every citizen.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The priests were favored in another way. Beside remaining in possession of their land, they received daily portions from Pharaoh, wherefore God said, &quot;The priests that serve idols receive all they need every day, how much more do the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are My priests, deserve that I should give them what they need every day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The rest of the inhabitants of Egypt, who had to part with their land, were not permitted to remain in their native provinces. Joseph removed them from their own cities, and settled them in others. His purpose herein was to prevent the Egyptians from speaking of his brethren derogatorily as &quot;exiles the sons of exiles&quot;; he made them all equally aliens. For the same reason, God later, at the time of the going forth of the Israelites from Egypt, caused all nations to change their dwelling-places about, so that the Israelites could not be reproached with having had to leave their home. And, finally, when Sermacherib carried the Jews away from their land into exile, it also happened that this king first mixed up the inhabitants of all the countries of the world.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_k2r6m5b1i7m4"/>Haggada - Jacob&apos;s Last Wish</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In return for the seventeen years that Jacob had devoted to the bringing up of Joseph, he was granted seventeen years of sojourn with his favorite son in peace and happiness. The wicked experience sorrow after joy; the pious must suffer first, and then they are happy, for all&apos;s well that ends well, and God permits the pious to spend the last years of their lives in felicity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Jacob felt his end approach, he summoned Joseph to his bedside, and he told him all there was in his heart. He called for Joseph rather than one of his other sons, because he was the only one in a position to execute his wishes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Jacob said to Joseph: &quot;If I have found grace in thy sight, bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. Only for thy sake did I come down into Egypt, and for thy sake I spoke, Now I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">can die. Do this for me as a true service of love, and not because thou art afraid, or because decency demands it. And when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt bury me in their burying-place. Carry me out of the land of idolatry, and bury me in the land where God hath caused His Name to dwell, and put me to rest in the place in which four husbands and wives are to be buried, I the last of them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob desired not to be buried in Egypt for several reasons. He knew that the soil of Egypt would once swarm with vermin, and it revolted him to think of his corpse exposed to such uncleanness. He feared, moreover, that his descendants might say, &quot;Were Egypt not a holy land, our father Jacob had never permitted himself to be buried there,&quot; and they might encourage themselves with this argument to make choice of Egypt as a permanent dwelling-place. Also, if his grave were there, the Egyptians might resort to it when the ten plagues came upon them, and if he were induced to pray for them to God, he would be advocating the cause of the Lord&apos;s enemies. If, on the other hand, he did not intercede for them, the Name of God would be profaned among the heathen, who would say, &quot;Jacob is a useless saint!&quot; Besides, it was possible that God might consider him, the &quot;scattered sheep&quot; of Israel, as a sacrifice for the Egyptians, and remit their punishment. From his knowledge of the people, another fear was justified, that his grave would become an object of idolatrous veneration, and the same punishment is appointed by God for the idols worshipped as for the idolaters that worship them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">If Jacob had good reasons for not wanting his body to rest in the soil of Egypt, he had equally good reasons for wanting it to rest in the Holy Land. In the Messianic time, when the dead will rise, those buried in Palestine will awaken to new life without delay, while those buried elsewhere will first have to roll from land to land through the earth, hollowed out for the purpose, until they reach the Holy Land, and only then will their resurrection take place. But over and beyond this, Jacob had an especial reason for desiring to have his body interred in Palestine. God had said to him at Beth-el, &quot;The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,&quot; and hence he made every endeavor to &quot;lie&quot; in the Holy Land, to make sure it would belong to him and his descendants. Nevertheless he bade Joseph strew some Egyptian earth over his dead body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Jacob expressed these his last wishes three times. Such is the requirement of good breeding in preferring a request.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the last period of Jacob&apos;s life, one can see how true it is that &quot;even a king depends upon favors in a strange land.&quot; Jacob, the man for the sake of whose merits the whole world was created, for the sake of whom Abraham was delivered from the fiery furnace, had to ask services of others while he was among strangers, and when Joseph promised to do his bidding, he bowed himself before his own son, for it is a true saying, &quot;Bow before the fox in his day,&quot; the day of his power.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He was not satisfied with a simple promise from Joseph, that he would do his wish; he insisted upon his taking an oath by the sign of the covenant of Abraham, putting a hand under his thigh in accordance with the ceremony customary among the Patriarchs! But Joseph said: &quot;Thou treatest me like a slave. With me thou hast no need to require an oath. Thy command sufficeth.&quot; Jacob, however, urged him, saying: &quot;I fear Pharaoh may command thee to bury me in the sepulchre with the kings of Egypt. I insist that thou takest an oath, and then I will be at peace.&quot; Joseph gave in, though he would not submit to the ceremony that Eliezer had used to confirm the oath he took at the request of his master Abraham. The slave acted in accordance with the rules of slavery, the free man acted in accordance with the dictates of freedom. And in a son that thing would have been unseemly which was becoming in a slave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Joseph swore to bury his father in Palestine, he added the words, &quot;As thou commandest me to do, so also will I beg my brethren, on my death-bed, to fulfil my last wish and carry my body from Egypt to Palestine.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Jacob, noticing the Shekinah over the bed&apos;s head, where she always rests in a sick room, bowed himself upon the bed&apos;s head, saying, &quot;I thank thee, O Lord my God, that none who is unfit came forth from my bed, but my bed was perfect.&quot; He was particularly grateful for the revelation God had vouchsafed him concerning his first-born son Reuben, that he had repented of his trespass against his father, and atoned for it by penance. He was thus assured that all his sons were men worthy of being the progenitors of the twelve tribes, and he was blessed with happiness such as </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">neither Abraham nor Isaac had known, for both of them had had unworthy as well as worthy sons.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Until the time of Jacob death had always come upon men suddenly, and snatched them away before they were warned of the imminent end by sickness. Once Jacob spoke to God, saying, &quot;O Lord of the world, a man dies suddenly, and he is not laid low first by sickness, and he cannot acquaint his children with his wishes regarding all he leaves behind. But if a man first fell sick, and felt that his end were drawing nigh, he would have time to set his house in order.&quot; And God said, &quot;Verily, thy request is sensible, and thou shalt be the first to profit by the new dispensation,&quot; and so it happened that Jacob fell sick a little while before his death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">His sickness troubled him grievously, for he had undergone much during his life. He had worked day and night while he was with Laban, and his conflicts with the angel and with Esau, though he came off victor from both, had weakened him, and he was not in a condition to endure the hardships of disease.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_25ehubiv441j"/>Haggada - The Blessing Of Ephraim And Manasseh</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">All the years of Jacob&apos;s sojourn in Egypt, Asenath, the wife of Joseph, was his constant nurse. When she saw his end drawing nigh, she spoke to Joseph: &quot;I have heard that one who is blessed by a righteous man is as though he had been blessed by the Shekinah. Therefore, bring thy sons hither, that Jacob give them his blessing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Though Joseph was a devoted and loving son to his father, he was not in constant attendance upon him, because he wanted to avoid giving him the opportunity of inquiring into the circumstances of his coming to Egypt. He was apprehensive that Jacob might curse his sons and bring death upon them, if he discovered the facts connected with their treacherous dealings with Joseph. He took good care therefore never to be alone with his father. But as he desired to be kept informed of his welfare, he arranged a courier service between himself and Jacob.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now when Joseph received the news of his father&apos;s having fallen sick, through his messenger, as well as through Ephraim, whom Jacob was instructing in the Torah, he hastened to the land of Goshen, taking his two sons with him. He desired to have </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">certainty upon five points: Would his father bless his two sons, who were born in Egypt, and, if so, would he appoint them to be heads of tribes? Would he assign the rights of the first-born unto himself, and, if so, would he divest Reuben of such rights altogether? And why had his father buried his mother Rachel by the wayside, and not carried her body to the family tomb at Machpelah?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob had also entertained doubts on five points, when he was about to emigrate from Canaan to Egypt: He did not know whether his descendants would lose themselves among the people of Egypt; whether he would die there and be buried there; and whether he would be permitted to see Joseph and see the sons of Joseph. God gave him the assurance, saying, &quot;I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will surely bring thee up again after thy death, and thy descendants also, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.&quot; When the time approached for the fulfilment of the Divine promise, God appeared unto Jacob, and He said, &quot;I promised to fulfil thy wish, and the time of fulfilment hath come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The holy spirit made known to Jacob that Joseph was coming to him, and he strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed in order to pay due respect to the representative of the government. Though Joseph was his son, he was also viceroy, and entitled to special marks of honor. Besides, Jacob desired to make the impression of being a man in good health. He wanted to avoid the possibility of having his blessing of Joseph and Joseph&apos;s sons questioned as the act of an irresponsible person.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He strengthened himself spiritually as well as physically, by prayer to God, in which he besought Him to let the holy spirit descend upon him at the time of his giving the blessing to the sons of Joseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Joseph appeared in the company of his two sons, his father said to him: &quot;In all the seventeen years thou hast been visiting me, thou didst never bring thy sons with thee, but now they have come, and I know the reason. If I bless them, I shall act in opposition to the word of God, who promised to make me the progenitor of twelve tribes, for if I adopt them as my sons, there will be fourteen tribes. But if I do not bless them, it will plunge thee in sorrow. So be it, I will bless them. But think not I do it because thou didst support me all these years. There is quite another reason. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">When I left my father&apos;s house to go to Haran, I offered up a prayer at Beth-el, and I promised to give unto God the tenth of all I owned. So far as my material possessions are concerned, I kept my vow, but I could not give the tithe of my sons, because according to the law I had to withdraw from the reckoning the four sons, Reuben, Joseph, Dan, and Gad, that are the first-born children of their mothers. When I returned, God again appeared unto me in Beth-el, and He said, Be fruitful and multiply. But after this blessing no son was born unto me except Benjamin alone, and it cannot be but that God meant Manasseh and Ephraim when He spoke of &apos;a nation and a company of nations.&apos; If now I have found favor in thy sight, thy two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simon, shall be mine, and then I shall be able to give a tenth part of my ten sons unto the Lord, and I shall leave this world free from the sin of not keeping my vow to the Lord concerning the tithe-giving.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph consented to do his father&apos;s will, and Jacob tithed his sons, consecrating Levi to the Holy One, and appointing him to be the chief of his brethren. He enjoined his sons to have a care that there should never fail them a son of Levi in the priestly succession. And it happened that. of all the tribes Levi was the only one that never proved faithless to the covenant of the fathers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus Jacob adopted Manasseh and Ephraim to be his own sons, even as Reuben and Simon were his sons. They were entitled like the others to a portion in the Holy Land, and like the others they were to bear standards on their journey through the desert.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Satisfied as to Jacob&apos;s intentions concerning his sons, Joseph asked his father about his mother&apos;s burial-place, and Jacob spoke, saying: &quot;As thou livest, thy wish to see thy mother lying by my side in the grave doth not exceed mine own. I had joy in life only as long as she was alive, and her death was the heaviest blow that ever fell upon me.&quot; Joseph questioned him: &quot;Perhaps thou didst have to bury her in the way, because she died during the rainy season, and thou couldst not carry her body through the rain to our family sepulchre?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; replied Jacob, &quot;she died in the spring time, when the highways are clean and firm.&quot; Joseph: &quot;Grant me permission to take up her body now and place it in our family burial-place.&quot; Jacob: &quot;No, my son, that thou </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">mayest not do. I was unwilling to bury her in the way, but the Lord commanded it.&quot; The reason of the command was that God knew that the Temple would be destroyed, and Israel would be carried away into banishment, and the exiles would ask the Patriarchs to intercede for them with God, but God would not hearken unto them. On their way to the land of the stranger they would pass the grave of Rachel, and they would throw themselves upon it, and beseech their mother to make intercession for them with God. And Rachel would pray to God in their behalf: &quot;O Lord of the world, look upon my tears, and have compassion upon my children. But if Thou wilt not take pity on them, then indemnify me for the wrong done to me.&quot; Unto her prayer God will hearken, and He will have mercy upon Israel. Therefore was Rachel buried in the way.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Jacob desired to bless the sons of Joseph, but the holy spirit made him to see Jeroboam, the descendant of Ephraim, and Jehu, the descendant of Manasseh, how they would seduce Israel to idolatry, and the Shekinah forsook him as he was about to lay his hands upon the heads of his grandsons. He said to Joseph, &quot;Is it possible that thou didst not marry the mother of thy children according to the law?&quot; Joseph thereupon brought his wife Asenath to his father, and pointing to her marriage contract, he said, &quot;This one is my wife, whom I married as is proper, with a marriage contract and due ceremony. I pray thee, my father, bless my sons if only for the sake of this pious woman.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob bade his grandsons approach close to him, and he kissed and embraced them, in the hope that his joy in them would lure back the holy spirit, but his hope was vain. Joseph concluded that the time was not favorable for blessing, and he decided to go away until a more propitious opportunity presented itself, first, however, proving to his father that his sons had been initiated in the covenant of Abraham.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Outside of his father&apos;s chamber, alone with his sons, he threw himself down before God and besought Him to show him mercy, and he bade his sons do likewise, saying, &quot;Be not content with your high station, for worldly honors are but for a time. Entreat God to be merciful and let the Shekinah descend upon my father, that he bless you </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">both.&quot; Then spake God to the holy spirit: &quot;How long yet shall Joseph suffer? Reveal thyself quickly, and enter into Jacob, that he may be able to bestow blessings.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the words of Jacob, &quot;Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simon, shall be mine,&quot; Joseph had noticed his father&apos;s preference for his younger son Ephraim. It made him very anxious about his older son&apos;s birthright, and he was careful to put the two lads before his father in such wise that Manasseh should stand opposite Jacob&apos;s right hand, and Ephraim opposite his left hand. But Ephraim, on account of his modesty, was destined for greater things than his older brother Manasseh, and God bade the holy spirit prompt Jacob to give the birthright to Ephraim. Now when Joseph observed his father put his right hand upon Ephraim&apos;s head, he made an attempt to remove it unto Manasseh&apos;s head. But Jacob warded him off, saying: &quot;What, thou wouldst displace my hand against my will, the hand that overcame the prince of the angel hosts, who is as large as one-third of the world! I know things not known to thee--I know what Reuben did to Bilhah, and what Judah did to Tamar. How much more do I know things known to thee! Thinkest thou I know not what thy brethren did to thee, because thou wouldst betray nothing whenever I asked thee? I know it, Manasseh also shall become great, the judge Gideon shall descend from him, but his younger brother will be the ancestor of Joshua, who will bring the sun and the moon to a standstill, though they have dominion over the whole earth from end to end.&quot; Thus did Jacob set Ephraim the younger above Manasseh the older, and thus did it remain unto all times. In the list of the generations, Manasseh comes after Ephraim, and so it was in the allotment of the portions in the Holy Land, and so it was in the placing of the camps and the standards of the tribes, and in the dedication of the Tabernacle--everywhere Ephraim preceded Manasseh.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The blessing bestowed upon his grandchildren by Jacob was as follows: &quot;O that it be the will of God that ye walk in the ways of the Lord like unto my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may the angel that hath redeemed me from all evil give his aid unto Joshua and Gideon, and reveal himself unto them. May your names be named on Israel, and like unto fishes may you grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth, and as fishes are protected by the water, so may you be protected by the merits of Joseph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The words &quot;like unto fishes&quot; were used by Jacob for the purpose of intimating the manner of death awaiting the Ephraimites, the descendants of Joseph. As fish are caught by their mouth, so the Ephraimites were in later days to invite their doom by their peculiar lisp. At the same time, Jacob&apos;s words contained the prophecy that Joshua the son of the man Nun, the &quot;fish,&quot; would lead Israel into the Holy Land. And in his words lay still another prophecy, with reference to the sixty thousand men children begot in the same night as Moses, all cast into the river with him, and saved for the sake of his merits. The number of boys thrown to the fishes in the river that night was equal to the number of men in Israel upon the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Ephraim received a special and separate blessing from his grandfather. Jacob said to him, &quot;Ephraim, my son, thou art the head of the Academy, and in the days to come my most excellent and celebrated descendants will be called Ephrati after thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph received two gifts from his father. The first was Shechem, the city that Jacob had defended, with sword and bow, against the depredations of the Amorite kings when they tried to take revenge upon his sons for the outrage committed there. And the second gift was the garments made by God for Adam and passed from hand to hand, until they came into the possession of Jacob. Shechem was his reward, because, with his chastity, he stemmed the tide of immorality that burst loose in Shechem first of all. Besides, he had a prior claim upon the city. Shechem, son of Hamor, the master of the city, had given it to Dinah as a present, and the wife of Joseph, Asenath, being the daughter of Dinah, the city belonged to him by right.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Adam&apos;s clothes Jacob had received from Esau. He had not taken them from his brother by force, but God had caused them to be given to him as a reward for his good deeds. They had belonged to Nimrod. Once when the mighty hunter caught Esau in his preserves, and forbade him to go on the chase, they agreed to determine by combat what their privileges were. Esau had taken counsel with Jacob, and he had advised him never to fight with Nimrod while he was clothed in Adam&apos;s garments. The two now wrestled with each other, and at the time Nimrod was not dressed in Adam&apos;s clothes. The end was that he was slain by Esau. Thus the garments worn by Adam fell into the hands of Esau, from him they passed into Jacob&apos;s, and he bequeathed them to Joseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Jacob also taught Joseph three signs whereby to distinguish the true redeemer, who should deliver Israel from the bondage of Egypt. He would proclaim the Ineffable Name, appoint elders, and use the word Pakod in addressing the people.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Joseph and his two sons left Jacob, his brethren, envious of the bountiful blessings bestowed upon the three, said, &quot;The whole world loveth a favorite of fortune, and our father hath blessed Joseph thus because he is a ruler of men.&quot; Then spoke Jacob: &quot;They that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. I have blessings enough for all.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob summoned his sons from the land of Egypt, and bade them come to him at Raamses, first, however, commanding them to make themselves clean, that the blessing he was about to bestow might attach itself to them. Another one of his commands was that they were to establish an Academy, by the members of which they were to be governed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When his sons were brought into his presence by the angels, Jacob spoke, saying, &quot;Take heed that no dissensions spring up among you, for union is the first condition of Israel&apos;s redemption,&quot; and he was on the point of revealing the great secret to them concerning the end of time, but while they were standing around the golden bed whereon their father lay, the Shekinah visited him for a moment and departed as quickly, and with her departed also all trace of the knowledge of the great mystery from the mind of Jacob. He had the same experience as his own father Isaac, who also had loss of memory inflicted upon him by God, to prevent him from revealing the secret at the end of time to Esau, when he summoned him to receive his blessing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The accident made Jacob apprehensive that his sons were not pious enough to be considered worthy of the revelation concerning the Messianic era, and he said to them, &quot;Ishmael and the sons of Keturah were the blemished among the issue of my grandfather Abraham; my father Isaac begot a blemished issue in Esau, and I fear now that among you, too, there is one that harbors the intention to serve idols.&quot; The twelve men spake, and said: &quot;Hear, O Israel, our father, the Eternal our God is the One </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Only God. As thy heart is one and united in avouching the Holy One, blessed be He, to be thy God, so also are our hearts one and united in avouching Him.&quot; Whereto Jacob responded, &quot;Praised be the Name of the glory of His majesty forever and ever!&quot; And although the whole mystery of the Messianic time was not communicated to the sons of Jacob, yet the blessing of each contained some reference to the events of the future.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These were the words addressed by Jacob to his oldest son: &quot;Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength! Thy portion should have been three crowns. Thou shouldst have had the double heritage of thy primogeniture, and the priestly dignity, and the royal power. But by reason of thy sin, the birthright is conferred upon Joseph, kingship upon Judah, and the priesthood upon Levi. My son, I know no healing remedy for thee, but the man Moses, who will ascend to God, he will make thee whole, and God will forgive thy sin. I bless thee--may thy descendants be heroes in the Torah and heroes in war. Though thou must lose thy birthright, yet wilt thou be the first to enter into possession of thy allotment in the Holy Land, and in thy territory shall be the first of the cities of refuge, and always shall thy name stand first in the list of the families of the tribes. Yea, thou shalt also be the first whose heritage will be seized by the enemy, and the first to be carried away into the lands of exile.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After Reuben had had his &quot;ears pulled&quot; thus, he retired, and Jacob called his sons Simon and Levi to his side, and he addressed them in these words: &quot;Brethren ye were of Dinah, but not of Joseph, whom you sold into slavery. The weapons of violence wherewith ye smote Shechem were stolen weapons, for it was not seemly for you to draw the sword. That was Esau&apos;s portion. To him was it said, By thy sword shalt thou live. Into the council of the tribe of Simon my soul will not come when they foregather at Shittim to do vicious deeds, and my glory will not be united unto the assembly of Korah, the descendants of Levi. In their anger Simon and Levi slew the prince of Shechem, and in their self-will they sold Joseph the bull into slavery. Accursed was the city of Shechem when they entered to destroy it. If they remain united, no ruler will be able to stand up before them, no war will prosper against them. Therefore will I divide and scatter their possession among the possessions of the other tribes. The descendants of Simon will many of them be poor men, who will </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">wander from tribe to tribe and beg for bread, and also Levi&apos;s tribe will gather its tithes and gifts from all the others.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The words of Jacob, &quot;I will divide them in Jacob,&quot; spoken of Simon and Levi, were fulfilled on Simon in particular. When twenty-four thousand of Simon fell at Shittim, the widows they left behind married husbands of all the other tribes. Nevertheless Jacob did not dismiss Simon and Levi without blessing them; the tribe of Simon was to bring forth the teachers and the beadles needed by all Israel, and Levi, the scholars that would expound the Torah and render decisions according to its teachings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When the remaining sons of Jacob heard the rebukes dealt out by their father to these three, they feared to hear like reproaches, and they tried to slip away from his presence. Especially Judah was alarmed, that his father might taunt him with his trespass touching Tamar. But Jacob spoke thus to him: &quot;Judah, thou dost deserve thy name. Thy mother called thee Jehudah, because she gave praise to God at thy birth, and so shall thy brethren praise thee, and they all will call themselves by thy name. And as thou didst confess thy sin openly, so also thy descendants, Achan, David, and Manasseh, will make public avowal of their sins, and the Lord will hear their prayer. Thy hands will send darts after the fleeing foe, and thy father&apos;s sons shall pay thee respect. Thou hast the impudence of a dog and the bravery of a lion. Thou didst save Joseph from death, and Tamar and her two sons from the flames. No people and no kingdom will be able to stand up against thee. Rulers shall not cease from the house of Judah, nor teachers of the law from his posterity, until his descendant Messiah come, and the obedience of all peoples be unto him. How glorious is Messiah of the House of Judah! His loins girded, he will go out to do battle with his enemies. No king and no ruler will prevail against him. The mountains will be dyed red with their blood, and the garments of Messiah will be like the garments of him that presseth wine. The eyes of Messiah will be clearer than pure wine, for they will never behold unchastity and bloodshed; and his teeth will be whiter than milk, for never will they bite aught that is taken by violence.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Though Issachar was the older, Zebulon came next to be blessed, as a reward for the sacrifice he had made for his brother&apos;s sake, for when Issachar chose the study of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the Torah as his vocation, Zebulon decided to devote himself to business and support his brother with the profits of his trade, that he might give himself up to the law undisturbed. His blessing was that he would conquer the seacoast as far as Zidon.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Issachar,&quot; said Jacob, &quot;will take upon himself the burden of the study of the Torah, and all the other tribes will come to him and ask him to decide their doubts on legal questions, and his descendants will be the members of the Sanhedrin and the scholars that will occupy themselves with fixing the calendar.&quot; Jacob blessed Issachar also with the blessing, that the fruits of his land should be exceedingly large, and this brought a heavenly as well as an earthly profit in its train, for when the heathen to whom the fruits were sold marvelled thereat, the Jewish merchants explained that their extraordinary size was due to the merits of the tribe of Issachar, whom God rewarded for their devotion to the Torah, and thus many of the heathen were induced to convert to Judaism.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In blessing Dan, Jacob&apos;s thoughts were occupied chiefly with his descendant Samson, who, like unto God, without any manner of assistance, conferred victory upon his people. Jacob even believed the strong, heroic man to be the Messiah, but when Samson&apos;s death was revealed to him, he exclaimed, &quot;I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord, for Thy help is unto all eternity, while Samson&apos;s help is only for a time. The redemption&quot; continued Jacob, &quot;will not be accomplished by Samson the Danite, but by Elijah the Gadite, who will appear at the end of time.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Asher&apos;s blessing was the beauty of his women, who would be sought in marriage by kings and high priests.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In Naphtali&apos;s land all fruits would ripen quickly, and they would be brought as presents to kings, and gain royal favor for the givers. This blessing was fulfilled in the plain of Gennesaret. At the same time Naphtali&apos;s blessing was a prophecy concerning his descendant Deborah, who was like a hind let loose against Sisera to conquer him, and she gave goodly words in her song of Israel&apos;s victory. Naphtali himself deserved the description applied to Deborah, for he was swift as a hart to do the will of God, and he was a fleet messenger unto his father and the tribes. They sent him whithersoever they would, and he executed their errands with dispatch. He </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">served the brethren of Joseph as herald, to announce unto Jacob the glad tidings, &quot;Joseph is yet alive,&quot; and when the stricken father saw him approach, he said, &quot;Lo, here cometh Naphtali the lovable, who proclaimeth peace.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph&apos;s blessing exceeded the blessing of all his brethren. Jacob spoke: &quot;O son whom I bred up, Joseph, whom I raised, and who wast strong to resist the enticements of sin, thou didst conquer all the magicians and the wise men of Egypt by thy wisdom and thy pious deeds. The daughters of princes cast their jewels before thee, to draw thine eyes upon them when thou didst pass through the land of Egypt, but thou didst not look their way, and therefore wast thou made the father of two tribes. The magicians and the wise men of Egypt sought to defame thee before Pharaoh and slander thee, but thou didst set thy hope in the Almighty. Therefore may He who appeared unto me as El Shaddai bless thee and grant thee fertile soil and much cattle. May the blessing thy father giveth thee now, and the blessing that his fathers Abraham and Isaac gave him, and that called forth the envy of the great of the world, Ishmael, Esau, and the sons of Keturah--may all these blessings be a crown upon the head of Joseph, and a chain upon the neck of him that was the ruler of Egypt, and yet diminished not the honor due to his brethren.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The slander of which Jacob spoke referred to what Potiphar had said of Joseph before Pharaoh. He had complained, saying, &quot;Why didst thou appoint my slave, whom I did buy for twenty pieces of silver, to be ruler over the Egyptians?&quot; Joseph had then taken up his own defense, saying: &quot;When thou didst buy me as a slave, thou didst commit a capital crime. Only a descendant of Canaan may be sold as a slave, and I am a descendant of Shem, and a prince besides. If thou wilt convince thyself of the truth of my words, do but compare me with the likeness of my mother Sarah that Pharaoh had made of her!&quot; They brought Sarah&apos;s likeness, and, verily, it appeared that Joseph resembled his ancestress, and all were convinced of his noble lineage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The blessing that Jacob bestowed upon Benjamin contains the prophecy that his tribe would provide Israel with his first ruler and his last ruler, and so it was, for Saul and Esther both belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. Likewise Benjamin&apos;s heritage in the Holy Land harbors two extremes: Jericho ripens its fruits earlier than any other </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">region in Palestine, while Beth-el ripens them latest. In Benjamin&apos;s blessing, Jacob referred also to the service in the Temple, because the Holy Place was situated in the territory of Benjamin. And when Jacob called his youngest son a wolf that ravineth, he was thinking of the judge Ehud, the great scholar, a Benjamite, who conquered Eglon king of Moab, and also he had in mind the Benjamites that captured their wives by cunning and force.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Again, if he called Benjamin a wolf, Judah a lion, and Joseph a bull, he wanted to point to the three kingdoms known as wolf, lion, and bull, the doom of which was and will be sealed by the descendants of his three sons: Babylon, the kingdom of the lion, fell through the hands of Daniel of the tribe of Judah; Media, the wolf, found its master in the Benjamite Mordecai; and the bull Joseph will subdue the horned beast, the kingdom of wickedness, before the Messianic time.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After Jacob had blessed each of his sons separately, he addressed himself to all of them together, saying: &quot;According to my power did I bless you, but in future days a prophet will arise, and this man Moses will bless you, too, and he will continue my blessings where I left off.&quot; He added, besides, that the blessing of each tribe should redound to the good of all the other tribes: the tribe of Judah should have a share in the fine wheat of the tribe of Benjamin, and Benjamin should enjoy the goodly barley of Judah. The tribes should be mutually helpful, one to another.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moreover, he charged them not to be guilty of idolatry in any form or shape and not to let blasphemous speech pass their lips, and he taught them the order of transporting his bier, thus: &quot;Joseph, being king, shall not help to bear it, nor shall Levi, who is destined to carry the Ark of the Shekinah. Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon shall grasp its front end, Reuben, Simon, and Gad its right side, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin the hindmost end, and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali its left side.&quot; And this was the order in which the tribes, bearing each its standard, were to march through the desert, the Shekinah dwelling in the midst of them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Jacob then spake to Joseph, saying: &quot;And thou, my son Joseph, forgive thy brethren for their trespass against thee, forsake them not, and grieve them not, for the Lord </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">hath put them into thine hands, that thou shouldst protect them all thy days against the Egyptians.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Also he admonished his sons, saying that the Lord would be with them if they walked in His ways, and He would redeem them from the hands of the Egyptians. &quot;I know,&quot; he continued, &quot;great suffering will befall your sons and your grandsons in this land, but if you will obey God, and teach your sons to know Him, then He will send you a redeemer, who will bring you forth out of Egypt and lead you into the land of your fathers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In resignation to the will of God, Jacob awaited his end, and death enveloped him gently. Not the Angel of Death ended his life, but the Shekinah took his soul with a kiss. Beside the three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, only Moses, Aaron, and Miriam breathed their last in this manner, through the kiss of the Shekinah. And these six, together with Benjamin, are the only ones whose corpses are not exposed to the ravages of the worms, and they neither corrupt nor decay.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus Jacob departed this world, and entered the world to come, a foretaste of which he had enjoyed here below, like the other two Patriarchs, and none beside among men. In another respect their life in this world resembled their life in the world to come, the evil inclination had no power over them, either here or there, wherein David resembled them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph ordered his father&apos;s body to be placed upon a couch of ivory, covered with gold, studded with gems, and hung with drapery of byssus and purple. Fragrant wine was poured out at its side, and aromatic spices burnt next to it. Heroes of the house of Esau, princes of the family of Ishmael, and the lion Judah, the bravest of his sons, surrounded the sumptuous bier of Jacob. &quot;Come,&quot; said Judah to his brethren, &quot;let us plant a high cedar tree at the head of our father&apos;s grave, its top shall reach up to the skies, its branches shall shade all the inhabitants of the earth, and its roots shall grow down deep into the earth, unto the abyss. For from him are sprung twelve tribes, and from him will arise kings and rulers, chapters of priests prepared to perform the service of the sacrifices, and companies of Levites ready to sing psalms and play upon sweet instruments.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The sons of Jacob tore their garments and girded their loins with sackcloth, threw themselves upon the ground, and strewed earth upon their heads until the dust rose in a high cloud. And when Asenath, the wife of Joseph, heard the tidings of Jacob&apos;s death, she came, and with her came the women of Egypt, to weep and mourn over him. And the men of Egypt that had known Jacob repaired thither, and they mourned day after day, and also many journeyed down into Egypt from Canaan, to take part in the seventy days&apos; mourning made for him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Egyptians spake to one another, saying, &quot;Let us lament for the pious man Jacob, because the affliction of the famine was averted from our land on account of his merits,&quot; for instead of ravaging the land for forty-two years according to the decree of God, the famine had lasted but two years, and that was due to the virtues of Jacob.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph ordered the physicians to embalm the corpse. This he should have refrained from doing, for it was displeasing to God, who spoke, saying: &quot;Have I not the power to preserve the corpse of this pious man from corruption? Was it not I that spoke the reassuring words, Fear not the worm, O Jacob, thou dead Israel?&quot; Joseph&apos;s punishment for this useless precaution was that he was the first of the sons of Jacob to suffer death. The Egyptians, on the other hand, who devoted forty days to embalming the corpse and preparing it for burial, were rewarded for the veneration they showed. Before He destroyed their city, God gave the Ninevites a forty days&apos; respite on account of their king, who was the Pharaoh of Egypt. And for the three score and ten days of mourning that the heathen made for Jacob, they were recompensed at the time of Ahasuerus. During seventy days, from the thirteenth of Nisan, the date of Haman&apos;s edict ordering the extermination of the Jews, until the twenty-third of Siwan, when Mordecai recalled it, they were permitted to enjoy absolute power over the Jews.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When all preparations for the burial of Jacob had been completed, Joseph asked permission of Pharaoh to carry the body up into Canaan. But he did not himself go to put his petition before Pharaoh, for he could not well appear before the king in the garb of a mourner, nor was he willing to interrupt his lamentation over his father for even a brief space and stand before Pharaoh and prefer his petition. He requested </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the family of Pharaoh to intercede for him with the king for the additional reason that he was desirous of enlisting the favor of the king&apos;s relations, lest they advise Pharaoh not to fulfil his wish. He acted according to the maxim, &quot;Seek to win over the accuser, that he cause thee no annoyance.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph applied first to the queen&apos;s hairdresser, and she influenced the queen to favor him, and then the queen put in a good word for him with the king. At first Pharaoh refused the permission craved by Joseph, who, however, urged him to consider the solemn oath he had given his dying father, to bury him in Canaan. Pharaoh desired him to seek absolution from the oath. But Joseph rejoined, &quot;Then will I apply also for absolution from the oath I gave thee,&quot; referring to an incident in his earlier history. The grandees of Egypt had advised Pharaoh against appointing Joseph as viceroy, and they did not recede from this counsel until Joseph, in his conversation with the Egyptian king, proved himself to be master of the seventy languages of the world, the necessary condition to be fulfilled before one could become ruler over Egypt. But the conversation proved something else, that Pharaoh himself was not entitled to Egyptian kingship, because he lacked knowledge of Hebrew. He feared, if the truth became known, Joseph would be raised to his own place, for he knew Hebrew beside all the other tongues. In his anxiety and distress, Pharaoh made Joseph swear an oath never to betray the king&apos;s ignorance of Hebrew. Now when Joseph threatened to have himself absolved from this oath as well as the one to his dying father, great terror overwhelmed him, and he speedily granted Joseph permission to go up to Canaan and bury his father there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moreover, Pharaoh issued a decree in all parts of the land menacing those with death who would not accompany Joseph and his brethren upon their journey to Canaan with their father&apos;s remains, and accordingly the procession that followed the bier of Jacob was made up of the princes and nobles of Egypt as well as the common people. The bier was borne by the sons of Jacob. In obedience to his wish not even their children were allowed to touch it. It was fashioned of pure gold, the border thereof inlaid with onyx stones and bdellium, and the cover was gold woven work joined to the bier with threads that were held together with hooks of onyx stones and bdellium. Joseph placed a large golden crown upon the head of his father, and a golden sceptre he put in his hand, arraying him like a living king.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The funeral cortege was arranged in this order: First came the valiant men of Pharaoh and the valiant men of Joseph, and then the rest of the inhabitants of Egypt. All were girt with swords and clothed in coats of mail, and the trappings of war were upon them. The weepers and mourners walked, crying and lamenting, at some distance from the bier, and the rest of the people went behind it, while Joseph and his household followed together after it, with bare feet and in tears, and Joseph&apos;s servants were close to him, each man with his accoutrements and weapons of war. Fifty of Jacob&apos;s servants preceded the bier, strewing myrrh upon the road in passing, and all manner of perfumes, so that the sons of Jacob trod upon the aromatic spices as they carried the body forward.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus the procession moved on until it reached Canaan. It halted at the threshing-floor of Atad, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. But the greatest honor conferred upon Jacob was the presence of the Shekinah, who accompanied the cortege.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Canaanites had no intention at first to take part in the mourning made for Jacob, but when they saw the honors shown him, they joined the procession of the Egyptians, loosing the girdles of their garments as a sign of grief. Also the sons of Esau, Ishmael, and Keturah appeared, though their design in coming was to seize the opportunity and make war upon the sons of Jacob, but when they saw Joseph&apos;s crown suspended from the bier, the Edomite and Ishmaelite kings and princes followed his example, and attached theirs to it, too, and it was ornamented with thirty-six crowns.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Nevertheless the conflict was not averted; it broke out in the end between the sons of Jacob and Esau and his followers. When the former were about to lower the body of their father into the Cave of Machpelah, Esau attempted to prevent it, saying that Jacob had used his allotted portion of the tomb for Leah, and the only space left for a grave belonged to himself. For, continued Esau, &quot;though I sold my birthright unto Jacob, I yet have a portion in the tomb as a son of Isaac.&quot; The sons of Jacob, however, were well aware of the fact that their father had acquired Esau&apos;s share in the Cave, and they even knew that a bill of sale existed, but Esau, assuming properly that the document was left behind in Egypt, denied that any such had ever been </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">made out, and the sons of Jacob sent Naphtali, the fleet runner, back to Egypt to fetch the bill. Meantime, while this altercation was going on between Esau and the others, Hushim the son of Dan arose and inquired in astonishment why they did not proceed with the burial of Jacob, for he was deaf and had not understood the words that had passed between the disputants. When he heard what it was all about, and that the ceremonies were interrupted until Naphtali should return from Egypt with the bill of sale, he exclaimed, with indignation, &quot;My grandfather shall lie here unburied until Naphtali comes back!&quot; and he seized a club and dealt Esau a vigorous blow, so that he died, and his eyes fell out of their sockets and dropped upon Jacob&apos;s knees, and Jacob opened his own eyes and smiled. Esau being dead, his brother&apos;s burial could proceed without hindrance, and Joseph interred him in the Cave of Machpelah in accordance with his wish.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">His other children had left all arrangements connected with the burial of their father&apos;s body to their brother Joseph, for they reflected that it was a greater honor for Jacob if a king concerned himself about his remains rather than simple private individuals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The head of Esau, as he lay slain by the side of Jacob&apos;s grave, rolled down into the Cave, and fell into the lap of Isaac, who prayed to God to have mercy upon his son, but his supplications were in vain. God spoke, saying, &quot;As I live, he shall not behold the majesty of the Lord.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_90tzn8o0ssf4"/>Haggada - The Sons Of Jacob At War With The Sons Of Esau</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob having been interred with royal pomp, and the seven days&apos; period of mourning over, the conflict between the sons of Jacob and the sons of Esau broke out anew. In the skirmish that had ensued when Esau advanced a claim upon a place in the Cave of Machpelah, while his brother&apos;s remains still lay unburied, he lost forty of his men, and after his death fortune favored his sons as little. Eighty of their followers were slain, while of the sons of Jacob not one was lost. Joseph succeeded in capturing Zepho the son of Eliphaz and fifty of his men, and he clapped them in chains and carried them off to Egypt. Thereupon the rest of the attacking army led by Eliphaz fled to Mount Seir, taking with them the headless corpse of Esau, to bury it in his own territory. The sons of Jacob pursued after them, but they slew none, out of respect for the remains of Esau.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>On the third day a great army gathered together, consisting of the inhabitants of Seir and the children of the East, and they marched down into Egypt with the purpose of making war upon Joseph and his brethren. In the battle that came off, this army was almost totally destroyed, not less than six hundred thousand men were mowed down by Joseph and his warriors, and the small remnant fled precipitately. Returned to their own country after this fatal campaign, the sons of Esau and the sons of Seir fell to quarrelling among themselves, and the sons of Seir demanded that their former allies leave the place, because it was they that had brought misfortune upon the country.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sons of Esau thereupon dispatched a messenger in secret to their friend Agnias, king of Africa, begging his aid against the sons of Seir. He granted their request, and sent them troops consisting of foot-soldiers and mounted men. The sons of Seir, on their part, also sought allies, and they secured the help of the children of the East, and of the Midianites, who put warriors at their disposal. In the encounters that ensued between the hostile forces, the sons of Esau were defeated again and again, partly on account of treachery in their own ranks, for their men sometimes deserted to the enemy while the combat was on. At last, however, in the battle that took place in the desert of Paran, the sons of Esau gained a decisive victory. They massacred all the warriors of the sons of Seir, and the Midianites and the children of the East were put to flight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thereafter the sons of Esau returned to Seir, and they slew all the inhabitants of the place, men, women, and children, sparing only fifty lads and maidens. The former they used as slaves, and the latter they took to wife. They also enriched themselves with the spoils, seizing all the possessions of the sons of Seir, and the whole land was divided among the five sons of Esau. Now these descendants of Esau determined to put a king over themselves, but in consequence of the treachery committed during the war there prevailed such hatred and bitterness among them that they decided never to appoint a ruler from their own people. Their choice fell upon Bela, the son of Beor, one of the warriors sent to them by King Agnias. His peer could not be found among the allied troops for bravery, wisdom, and handsome appearance. They set the royal crown upon his head, built a palace for him, and gave </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">him gifts of silver, gold, and gems, until he lived in great opulence. He reigned happily for thirty years, and met his death then in a war against Joseph and his brethren.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This war came about because the sons of Esau could not banish from their memory the disgrace of the defeat inflicted upon them by Joseph and his people. Having enlisted the aid of Agnias, and of the Ishmaelites and other nations of the East, they set forth on a second campaign against Egypt, in the hope of delivering Zepho and his followers from the hands of Joseph. In spite of their enormous host--they had no less than eight hundred thousand men of infantry and cavalry--they were defeated at Raamses by Joseph and his brethren and their little company of six hundred men. Beside their king Bela, they left one-fourth of their army upon the field. The loss of their king discouraged them grievously, and they took to flight, hard pressed by Joseph, who cut down many of the fugitives.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When he returned from the battle, Joseph ordered manacles and fetters to be put upon Zepho and his followers, and their captivity was made more bitter unto them than it had been before.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sons of Esau appointed Jobab of Bozrah to succeed their dead king Bela. His reign lasted ten years, but they desisted from all further attempts at waging war with the sons of Jacob. Their last experience with them had been too painful, but the enmity they cherished against them was all the fiercer, and their hatred never abated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Their third king was Husham, and he ruled over them for twenty years. During his reign Zepho succeeded in making good his escape from Egypt. He was received kindly by Agnias, king of Africa, and appointed commander-in-chief of his troops. He used every means of persuasion to induce his sovereign lord to enter into a war with Egypt, but in vain, for Agnias was only too well acquainted with the strength and heroism of the sons of Jacob. For many years he resisted Zepho&apos;s arguments and blandishments. Indeed, as it was, Agnias had his hands full with other warlike enterprises. It had happened about this time that a man of the land of Kittim, &apos;Uzi by name, whom his countrymen venerated as a god, died in the city of Pozimana, and he left behind a fair and clever daughter. Agnias heard of Yaniah&apos;s beauty and wisdom, and he sued for her hand, and his request was granted him by the people of Kittim.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The messengers of Agnias were hastening away from Kittim, bearing to their master the promise of the inhabitants that Yaniah should become his wife, when Turnus, king of Benevento, arrived on the same errand. His suit was rejected, for the people of Kittim were afraid-to break the promise given to Agnias. In his anger, Turnus went to Sardinia to make war upon King Lucus, a brother of Agnias, intending to deal with the latter as soon as the other was rendered harmless. Hearing of the design hatched by Turnus, Agnias hastened to Sardinia to the assistance of his brother, and a battle took place in the Valley of Campania. Against Turnus were arrayed Agnias, his brother Lucus, and the son of the latter, Niblos, whom his father had appointed commander-in-chief of the Sardinian troops. In the first encounter, Turnus was the victor, and the Sardinians lost their general Niblos. But in the second engagement the army of Turnus was routed completely, and he himself was left dead on the field. His army fled, pursued closely by Agnias as far as the cross-road between Rome and Albano. Niblos&apos; body was put inside of a golden statue, and his father erected a high tower over his grave, and another over the grave of Turnus, and these two buildings, connected by a marble pavement, stand opposite to each other, on the cross-road at which Agnias left off from following after the fugitive army.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The king of Africa went on to the city of Benevento, but he took no harsh measures against it and its inhabitants, because it belonged to the land of Kittim at that time. Thenceforth, however, bands of soldiers from Africa made incursions, now and again, into the land of Kittim, under the lead of Zepho, the captain of the African army. Agnias meantime went to Pozimana, to solemnize his marriage with Yaniah, and he returned with her to his capital in Africa.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_6y09oalpavpk"/>Haggada - Zepho King Of Kittim</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">All this time Zepho did not leave off urging Agnias to invade Egypt, and he succeeded finally in persuading the king to consider his wish, and a great army was equipped against Egypt and the sons of Jacob. Among the shield-bearers was Balaam, the fifteen year old son of Beor, a wise youth and an adept in magic, and the king bade him acquaint him with the issue of the war upon which they were entering. Balaam took wax and moulded the figures of men, to represent the army of Agnias and the army of the Egyptians, and he plunged them into magic water and let them </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">swim, and it appeared that the African army was subdued by the Egyptians. Agnias accordingly gave up the campaign, and Zepho, seeing that his sovereign could not be persuaded into war with the sons of Jacob, fled the country and betook himself to Kittim.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The people of Kittim received him with great honors, and they offered him much money to stay with them and conduct their wars. It happened once while Zepho was in the mountains of Koptiziah, where the inhabitants of Kittim had taken refuge before the troops of the African king, that he had to go on a search for an ox that had strayed away, and he discovered a cave the opening of which was barred by a great stone. He shivered the stone in pieces, and entering the cave he saw an animal formed like a man above and a he-goat below, and he killed the strange beast, which was in the very act of devouring his lost ox. There was great rejoicing among the people of Kittim, for the monster had long been doing havoc among their cattle, and in gratitude they set aside one day of the year, which they called by Zepho&apos;s name, in honor of their liberator, and all the people brought him presents and offered sacrifices to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At this time it came to pass that Yaniah, the wife of King Agnias, fell into a grievous sickness, and the physicians ascribed her illness to the climate, and to the water of Africa, to which she, a native of the land of Kittim, could not get accustomed, because she had been in the habit of using the water of the river Forma, which her forefathers had drawn to her house through a conduit. Agnias sent to the land of Kittim and had some of the water of the Forma brought to Africa. Finding it much lighter than the water of his own country, he built a huge canal from the land of Kittim. to Africa, and the queen henceforth had all the Forma water she needed. Besides, he took earth and stone from Kittim, and built a palace for Yaniah, and she recovered from her illness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Meantime Zepho had won a decisive victory over the African troops that had made an incursion into the land of Kittim, and the people chose him as king. His first undertaking was a campaign against the sons of Tubal and the Islands of the Sea, and again he was successful, he subdued them completely. On his return, the people </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">built a great palace for Zepho, and they renewed his kingship, and he continued until his death to reign as king of Kittim and of Italy.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">During the first thirteen years of his reign, the Africans made no attempt to disturb the peace of Kittim, but then they invaded the land, only to be severely repulsed by Zepho, who pursued the troops up to the very borders of Africa, and Agnias the king was in such consternation that he did not venture to make reprisals for some time. When he finally made a second attempt, his troops were annihilated by Zepho down to the very last man. Now Agnias, in despair, assembled all the inhabitants of Africa, as numerous as the sand on the sea-shore, and he united his great host with the army of his brother Lucus, and thus he made his third attempt upon Zepho and the people of the land of Kittim.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Alarmed, Zepho wrote to his brethren in Seir, and entreated their king Hadad to send him aid. But the people of Seir had concluded an alliance with Agnias as far back as under their first king Bela, and they refused Zepho&apos;s request, and the king of Kittim had to face the host of eight hundred thousand men mustered by Agnias with his little band of three thousand. Then the people of Kittim spake to their king Zepho, saying: &quot;Pray for us unto the God of thy ancestors. Peradventure He may deliver us from the hand of Agnias and his army, for we have heard that He is a great God, and He delivers all that trust in Him.&quot; Zepho prayed unto the Lord, saying: &quot;O Lord, God of Abraham and Isaac, my fathers, this day may it be made known that Thou art a true God, and all the gods of the nations are vain and useless. Remember now this day unto me Thy covenant with Abraham our father, which our ancestors related unto us, and do graciously with me this day for the sake of Abraham and Isaac, our fathers, and save me and the sons of Kittim from the hand of the king of Africa, who hath come against us for battle.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God gave ear unto Zepho&apos;s prayer, and in the first day&apos;s battle one-half of the African army fell. Agnias forthwith dispatched a decree to his country, ordering, on penalty of death and confiscation of property, that all the males of the land, including boys that had passed their tenth year, were to join the army and fight against the people of Kittim. In spite of these new accessions, three hundred thousand strong, Agnias was beaten again by Zepho in the second battle. The African general Sosipater having </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">fallen slain, the troops broke into flight, at their head Agnias with Lucus the brother and Asdrubal the son of Agnias. After this dire defeat the Africans made no further attempt to disturb the peace of Kittim, and their incursions ceased forever.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In spite of the great victory that Zepho had won with the help of God, the king of Kittim walked in the idolatrous ways of the people whom he ruled, and in the ways of the sons of Esau, for, as saith the proverb of the ancients, &quot;Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness,&quot; and Zepho was not other than the rest of the sons of Esau.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The severe defeat inflicted upon Agnias drove Balaam from Africa to Kittim, and he was received with great honors by Zepho, who welcomed him on account of his deep wisdom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Zepho thought the time had arrived for him to carry out his plan of vengeance against the posterity of Jacob, all the more as in the meantime Joseph had died, and also his brethren and the valiant men of Pharaoh had passed away. He was joined in the enterprise by Hadad, the king of Edom, and by the nations of the East and the Ishmaelites. The allied army was so vast that the space it covered as it stood in rank and file was equal to a three days&apos; journey. It formed in battle array in the Valley of Pathros, and it was met by three hundred thousand Egyptians and one hundred and fifty Israelites from Goshen. But the Egyptians did not trust the Israelites, they feared their defection to the sons of Esau and Ishmael. They therefore made an agreement with them that the Israelites were not to come to the help of the Egyptians until it appeared that the enemy were getting the upper hand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Zepho, who had a high opinion of Balaam&apos;s ability, desired him to use his magic arts and find out what would be the outcome of the war, but Balaam&apos;s knowledge failed him, he could not satisfy the king&apos;s wish. The Egyptians got the worst of the first encounter between the two hostile armies, but the aspect of things changed as soon as they summoned the Israelites to aid them. The Israelites prayed to God to support them with His help, and the Lord heard their prayer. Then they threw themselves upon Zepho and his allies, and after they had cut down several thousand men, such dismay and confusion took hold of the enemy that they fled hastily, pursued by the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Israelites as far as the boundary of the country. The Egyptians, instead of coming to the assistance of the Israelites, had taken to flight, leaving the small band of their allies to dispose of the huge host of their adversaries. Embittered by such treatment, the Israelites slew as many as two hundred Egyptians, under the pretext that they thought they belonged to the enemy.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Hadad, the king of Edom, who had failed to gain fame and honor in the Egyptian campaign, was favored by fortune in another war, a war against Moab. The Moabites shrank from meeting Hadad alone, and they made an alliance with the Midianites. In the thick of the fight the Moabites fled from the field of battle, leaving the Midianites to their fate, and these deserted allies of theirs were cut down to a man by Hadad and his Edomites. The Moabites saved their skins, and suffered only the inconvenience of having to pay tribute. To avenge the faithlessness practiced against them, the Midianites, supported by their kinsmen, the sons of Keturah, gathered a mighty army, and attacked the Moabites the following year. But Hadad came to their assistance, and again he inflicted a severe defeat upon the Midianites, who had to give up their plan of revenge against Moab. This is the beginning of the inveterate enmity between the Moabites and the Midianites. If a single Moabite is caught in the land of Midian, he is killed without mercy, and a Midianite in Moab fares no better.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After the death of Hadad, the Edomites installed Samlah of Masrekah as their king, and he reigned eighteen years. It was his desire to take up the cause of Agnias, the old ally of the Edomites, and chastise Zepho for having gone to war with him, but his people, the Edomites, would not permit him to undertake aught that was inimical to their kinsman, and Samlah had to abandon the plan. In the fourteenth year of Samlah&apos;s reign, Zepho died, having been king of Kittim for fifty years. His successor was Janus, one of the people of Kittim, who enjoyed an equally long reign.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Balaam had made his escape to Egypt after the death of Zepho, and he was received there with great demonstrations of honor by the king and all the nobles, and Pharaoh appointed him to be royal counsellor, for he had heard much about his exceeding great wisdom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>In the Edomite kingdom, Samlah was succeeded by Saul of Pethor, a youth of surpassing beauty, whose reign lasted forty years. His successor upon the throne was Baal Hamon, king for thirty-eight years, during which period the Moabites rose up against the Edomites, to whom they had been paying tribute since the time of Hadad, and they succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the stranger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The times were troubled everywhere. Agnias, the king of Africa, died, and also the death of Janus occurred, the king of Kittim. The successors to these two rulers, Asdrubal, the son of Agnias, and Latinus, the king of Kittim, then entered upon a long drawn out war of many years. At first the fortune of war favored Latinus. He sailed to Africa in ships, and inflicted one defeat after another upon Asdrubal, and finally this king of Africa lost his life upon the battlefield. After destroying the canal from Kittim to Africa built many years before by Agnias, Latinus returned to his own country, taking with him as his wife Ushpiziwnah, the daughter of Asdrubal, who was so wondrously beautiful that her countrymen wore her likeness upon their garments.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Latinus did not enjoy the fruits of his victory long. Anibal, the younger brother of Asdrubal and his successor in the royal power, went to Kittim in ships and carried on a series of wars lasting eighteen years, in the course of which he killed off eighty thousand of the people of Kittim, not sparing the princes and the nobles. At the end of this protracted period he went back to Africa, and reigned over his people in quiet and peace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Edomites, during the forty-eight years of the reign of Hadad, the successor of Baal Hamon, fared no better than the people of Kittim. Hadad&apos;s first undertaking was to reduce the Moabites again under the sovereignty of Edom, but he had to desist, because he could not offer successful resistance to a newly chosen king of theirs, one of their own people, who enlisted the aid of their kinsmen the Ammonites. The allies commanded a great host, and Hadad was overwhelmed. These wars were followed by others between Hadad of Edom. and Abimenos of Kittim. The latter was the attacking party, and he invaded Seir with a mighty army. The sons of Seir were defeated abjectly, their king Hadad was taken captive, and then executed by Abimenos, and Seir was made a province subject to Kittim and ruled by a governor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Thus ended the independence of the sons of Esau. Henceforth they had to pay tribute to Kittim, over which Abimenos ruled until his death, in the thirty-eighth year of his reign.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_g4x5sxxh3wau"/>Haggada - Joseph&apos;s Magnanimity</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Joseph was returning from the burial of his father in the Cave of Machpelah, he passed the pit into which his brethren had once cast him, and he looked into it, and said, &quot;Blessed be God who permitted a miracle to come to pass for me here!&quot; The brethren inferred from these words of gratitude, which Joseph but uttered in compliance with the injunctions of the law, that he cherished the recollection of the evil they had done him, and they feared, that now their father was dead, their brother would requite them in accordance with their deeds. They observed, moreover, that since their father was no more, Joseph had given up the habit of entertaining them at his table, and they interpreted this as a sign of his hatred of them. In reality, it was due to Joseph&apos;s respect and esteem for his brethren. &quot;So long as my father was alive,&quot; Joseph said to himself, &quot;he bade me sit at the head of the table, though Judah is king, and Reuben is the first-born. It was my father&apos;s wish, and I complied with it. But now it is not seemly that I should have the first seat in their presence, and yet, being ruler of Egypt, I cannot yield my place to any other.&quot; He thought it best therefore not to have the company of his brethren at his meals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But they, not fathoming his motives, sent Bilhah to him with the dying message of their father, that he was to forgive the transgression and the sin of his brethren. For the sake of the ways of peace they had invented the message; Jacob had said nothing like it. Joseph, on his part, realized that his brethren spoke thus only because they feared he might do harm unto them, and he wept that they should put so little trust in his affection. When they appeared, and fell down before his face, and said, &quot;Thou didst desire to make one of us a slave unto thyself. Behold, we all are ready to be thy servants,&quot; he spoke to them gently, and tried to convince them that he harbored no evil design against them. He said: &quot;Be not afraid, I will do you no harm, for I fear God, and if ye think I failed to have you sit at my table because of enmity toward you, God knows the intentions of my heart, He knows that I acted thus out of consideration for the respect I owe to you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Furthermore he said: &quot;Ye are like unto the dust of the earth, the sand on the sea-shore, and the stars in the heavens. Can I do aught to put these out of the world? Ten stars could effect nothing against one star, how much less can one star effect anything against ten? Do you believe that I have the power of acting contrary to the laws of nature? Twelve hours hath the day, twelve hours the night, twelve months the year, twelve constellations are in the heavens, and also there are twelve tribes! You are the trunk and I am the head--of what use the head without the trunk? It is to my own good that I should treat you with fraternal affection. Before your advent, I was looked upon as a slave in this country--you proved me a man of noble birth. Now, if I should kill you, my claims upon an aristocratic lineage would be shown to be a lie. The Egyptians would say, He was not their brother, they were strangers to him, he but called them his brethren to serve his purpose, and now he hath found a pretext to put them out of the way. Or they would hold me to be a man of no probity. Who plays false with his own kith and kin, how can he keep faith with others? And, in sooth, how can I venture to lay hand upon those whom God and my father both have blessed?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Joseph&apos;s dealings were kind and gentle with his brethren, so he was the helper and counsellor of the Egyptians, and when Pharaoh departed this life, Joseph being then a man of seventy-one years of age, the king&apos;s last wish was that he might be a father unto his son and successor Magron, and administer the affairs of state for him. Some of the Egyptians desired to make Joseph king after the death of Pharaoh, but this plan met with opposition on the part of others. They objected to an alien on the throne, and so the royal title was left to Magron, called Pharaoh, according to the established custom the name given to all the Egyptian kings. But Joseph was made the actual ruler of the land, and though he was only viceroy in Egypt, he reigned as king over the lands outside of Egypt as far as the Euphrates, parts of which Joseph had acquired by conquest. The inhabitants of these countries brought their yearly tribute to him and other presents besides, and thus did Joseph rule for forty years, beloved of all, and respected by the Egyptians and the other nations, and during all that time his brethren dwelt in Goshen, happy and blithe in the service of God. And in his own family circle Joseph was happy also; he lived to act as godfather at the circumcision of the sons of his grandson Machir.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>His end was premature as compared with that of his brethren; at his death he was younger than any of them at their death. It is true, &quot;Dominion buries him that exercises it.&quot; He died ten years before his allotted time, because, without taking umbrage, he had permitted his brethren to call his father his &quot;servant&quot; in his presence.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_swvsupjvifnj"/>Haggada - Asenath</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God gives every man the wife he deserves, and so Asenath was worthy of being the helpmeet of Joseph the pious. Her father was Potiphar, one of Pharaoh&apos;s magnates, ranking among the most distinguished of them by reason of wisdom, wealth, and station. His daughter was slender like unto Sarah, beautiful like Rebekah, and radiant in appearance like Rachel. Noblemen and princes sued for her hand when she was eighteen years of age. Even Pharaoh&apos;s appointed successor, his first-born son, demanded her in marriage, but his father refused to comply with his wish, because he did not consider her a proper wife for one destined to sit upon the throne. The daughter of the Moabite king, he insisted, was a more suitable match for him. But Asenath rejected every proposal of marriage, and avoided all intercourse with men. With seven maidens born the same day as herself, she lived in retirement in a magnificent palace adjoining that of her parents.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It happened in the first of the seven years of plenty that Joseph planned to visit the place in which Potiphar resided, and he sent word to him that he would put up with him, at his house. Potiphar was enchanted with the honor in prospect for him, and also with the opportunity it would afford him of bringing about a marriage between Asenath and Joseph. But when he disclosed his plan to his daughter, she rejected it with indignation. &quot;Why shouldst thou desire to see me united with a vagabond, a slave,&quot; she cried out, &quot;one that does not even belong to our nation, but is the son of a Canaanitish herdsman, a fellow that attempted to violate the honor of his mistress, and in punishment for this misdemeanor was thrown into prison, to be liberated thence by Pharaoh for interpreting his dream? Nay, father, never will I become his wife. I am willing to marry the son of Pharaoh, the future ruler and king of Egypt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Potiphar promised his daughter not to speak of the plan again. At that moment Joseph&apos;s arrival was announced, and Asenath left the presence of her parents and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">withdrew to her own apartments. Standing by the window, she saw Joseph pass, and she was so transported with his divine beauty and his indescribably noble carriage that she burst into tears, and said: &quot;Poor, foolish me, what shall I do? I permitted myself to be misled by friends, who told me that Joseph was the son of a Canaanitish shepherd. Now I behold the splendor that emanates from him like unto the splendor of the sun, illuminating our house with his rays. In my audacity and folly I had looked down upon him, and had spoken absurd nonsense against him. I knew not that he was a son of God, as he must be, for among men such beauty as his does not exist. I pray Thee, O God of Joseph, grant me pardon! It was my ignorance that made me speak like a fool. If my father will give me in marriage to Joseph, I will be his forever.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Meantime Joseph had taken his seat at Potiphar&apos;s table, and he observed a maiden looking at him from one of the palace windows. He commanded that she be ordered away, for he never permitted women to gaze at him or come near to him. His supernatural beauty always fascinated the noble Egyptian ladies, and they were untiring in the efforts they made to approach him. But their attempts were vain. He cherished the words of his father Jacob, who had admonished his son to keep aloof from the women of the Gentiles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Potiphar explained to Joseph that the maiden at the window was his virgin daughter, who never permitted men to abide near her; he was the first man she had ever looked upon. The father continued and made the request of Joseph, to allow his daughter to pay him her respects. Joseph granted the favor he desired, and Asenath appeared and greeted him with the words, &quot;Peace be with thee, thou blessed of God Most High,&quot; whereunto Joseph returned the salutation, &quot;Be thou blessed of the Lord, from whom flow all blessings.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Asenath desired also to kiss Joseph, but he warded off the intimate greeting with the words: &quot;It is not meet that a God-fearing man, who blesses the living God, and eats the blessed bread of life, who drinks of the blessed cup of immortality and incorruptibility, and anoints himself with the fragrant oil of holiness, should kiss a woman of a strange people, who blesses dead and unprofitable idols, and eats the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">putrid bread of idolatry, which chokes the soul of man, who drinks the libations of deceit, and anoints herself with the oil of destruction.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These words uttered by Joseph touched Asenath unto tears. Out of compassion with her, he bestowed his blessing upon her, calling upon God to pour out His spirit over her and make her to become a member of His people and His inheritance, and grant her a portion in the life eternal.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_pm2so7omufkm"/>Haggada - The Marriage Of Joseph</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The appearance and the speech of Joseph made so deep an impression upon Asenath that no sooner had she reached her apartment than she divested herself of her robes of state and took off her jewels, and put on sackcloth instead, strewed ashes upon her head, and supplicated God amid tears to grant her pardon for her sins. In this manner she spent seven days and seven nights in her chamber. Not even her seven attendants were permitted to enter her presence during the time of her penance. The morning of the eighth day an angel appeared unto her, and bade her put away her sackcloth and ashes and array herself in state, for this day she had been born anew, he said, to eat the blessed bread of life, to drink of the cup of life immortal, and anoint herself with the oil of life eternal. Asenath was about to set food and drink before her guest, when she perceived a honeycomb of wondrous form and fragrance. The angel explained to her that it had been produced by the bees of Paradise, to serve as food for the angels and the elect of God. He took a small portion of it for himself, and the rest he put into Asenath&apos;s mouth, saying: &quot;From this day forth thy body shall bloom like the eternal flowers in Paradise, thy bones shall wax fat like the cedars thereof, strength inexhaustible shall be thine, thy youth shall never fade, and thy beauty never perish, and thou shalt be like unto a metropolis surrounded by a wall.&quot; At the request of Asenath, the angel blessed also her seven attendants, with the words, &quot;May the Lord bless you and make you to be seven pillars in the City of Refuge.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thereupon the angel left her, and she saw him ascend heavenward in a chariot of fire drawn by four steeds of fire. Now she knew that she had not been entertaining a human being, but an angel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The celestial messenger had scarcely departed, when a visit from Joseph was announced, and she hastened to array and adorn herself for his reception. When she washed her face, she caught sight of it in the water, and saw it to be of such beauty as never before, so great had been the transformation wrought by the angel. When Joseph came, he did not recognize her. He asked her who she was, whereto she replied, &quot;I am thy maid-servant Asenath! I have cast away my idols, and this day a visitant came to me from heaven. He gave me to eat of the bread of life and to drink of the blessed cup, and he spake these words unto me, &apos;I give thee unto Joseph as his affianced wife, that he may be thy affianced husband forever.&apos; And furthermore he said, &apos;Thy name shall not any more be called Asenath, but thy name shall be City of Refuge, whither the nations shall flee for safety.&apos; And he added, &apos;I go to Joseph, to tell him all these things that have reference to thee.&apos; Now, my lord, thou knowest whether the man was with thee and spoke to thee in my behalf.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph confirmed all she had said, and they embraced and kissed each other in token of their betrothal, which they celebrated by a banquet with Potiphar and his wife. The wedding took place later in the presence of Pharaoh, who set a golden crown upon the head of the bridegroom and the bride, gave them his blessing, and made a seven days&apos; feast in their honor, to which he invited the magnates and princes of Egypt and of other countries. And during the seven days of the wedding festivities the people were prohibited, under penalty of death, from doing any manner of work; they all were to join in the celebration of Joseph&apos;s marriage.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_4ta385je7xfl"/>Haggada - Kind And Unkind Brethren</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">On the twenty-first day of the second month in the second of the seven years of famine, Jacob came down to Egypt, and his daughter-in-law Asenath visited him. She marvelled not a little at his beauty and strength. His shoulders and his arms were like an angel&apos;s, and his loins like a giant&apos;s. Jacob gave her his blessing, and with her husband she returned home, accompanied by the sons of Leah, while the sons of the handmaids, remembering the evil they had once done unto Joseph, kept aloof. Levi in particular had conceived a fondness for Asenath. He was especially close to the Living God, for he was a prophet and a sage, his eyes were open, and he knew how to read the celestial books written by the finger of God. He revealed to Asenath that he </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">had seen her future resting-place in heaven, and it was built upon a rock and encompassed by a diamond wall.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On their journey they met the son of Pharaoh, his successor to the throne, and he was so transported with Asenath&apos;s beauty, that he made the plan of murdering Joseph in order to secure possession of his wife. He summoned Simon and Levi, and by blandishments and promises sought to induce them to put Joseph out of the way. Simon was so enraged that he would have felled him at once, had not his brother Levi, who was endowed with the gift of prophecy, divined his purpose, and frustrated it by stepping upon his foot, while whispering: &quot;Why art thou so angry, and so wroth with the man? We that fear God may not repay evil with evil.&quot; Turning to the son of Pharaoh, he told him that nothing would induce them to execute the wickedness he had proposed; rather he advised him not to undertake aught against Joseph, else he would kill him with the sword that had served him in his slaughter of the inhabitants of Shechem. The culprit was seized with frantic alarm, and fell down before Simon and Levi to entreat their mercy. Levi raised him tip, saying, &quot;Fear not, but abandon thy wicked plan, and harbor no evil design against Joseph.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Nevertheless the son of Pharaoh did not give up his criminal purpose. He approached the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, and sought to accomplish through them what had failed with Simon and Levi. He called them into his presence, and told them of a conversation between Joseph and Pharaoh that he had overheard. The former had said that he waited but to learn of the death of his father Jacob in order to do away with the sons of the handmaids, because they had been the ones to sell him into slavery. Their wrath excited against Joseph by these words, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah assented to the proposition of the son of Pharaoh. It was arranged that the latter should kill Pharaoh, the friend of Joseph, while they would fall upon their brother, and put him out of the way. They were furnished with six hundred able warriors and fifty spearmen for the purpose. The first part of the plan, the murder of Pharaoh, failed. The palace guard would not allow even the successor to the throne to enter his father&apos;s bedchamber, and he had to depart without having effected his object.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Now Dan and Gad gave him the advice to take up his station with fifty archers in a secret place that Asenath had to pass on her homeward journey. Thence he could make a successful attack upon her suite, and gain possession of her. Naphtali and Asher did not care to have anything to do with this hostile enterprise against Joseph, but Dan and Gad forced them into it, insisting that all the sons of the handmaids must stand together as men and repel the danger that threatened them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">From their ambush the forces of the son of Pharaoh fell upon Asenath and her six hundred attendants. They succeeded in hewing down the vanguard, and Asenath had to take to flight. To her alarm she encountered the son of Pharaoh with fifty mounted men. Benjamin, seated in the same chariot with her, came to her rescue, for in spite of his youth he was exceedingly courageous. He descended from the chariot, gathered pebbles, and, throwing them at the son of Pharaoh, struck him on his forehead and inflicted a severe wound. The charioteer aided him by keeping him supplied with pebbles, which he cast at the fifty riders with such expert skill that he slew forty-eight of them with as many missiles. Meantime the sons of Leah arrived on the spot and came to Asenath&apos;s aid, for Levi, with his prophetic spirit, had seen what was happening, and summoning his five brothers he had hastened thither. These six attacked the troops in ambush and cut them down. But the danger to Asenath was by no means removed. At this moment the sons of the handmaids threw themselves upon her and Benjamin with drawn swords. It was their intention to kill them both, and flee to cover in the depths of the woods. But as soon as Asenath supplicated God for aid, the swords dropped from the hands of her assailants, and they saw that the Lord was on the side of Asenath. They fell at her feet and entreated her grace. She allayed their anxiety with the words: &quot;Be courageous and have no fear of your brethren, the sons of Leah. They are God-fearing men. Do but keep yourselves in hiding until their wrath is appeased.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the sons of Leah appeared, Asenath fell down before them, and amid tears she adjured them to spare the sons of the handmaids and not repay with evil the evil they had meditated. Simon would not hear of making concessions. He insisted that the measure of their sins was full, and they must pay for them with their lives, for they </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">had been the ones that had sold Joseph into slavery, and brought down untold misfortune upon Jacob and his sons. But Asenath did not leave off, and her urgent petitions won the day. She succeeded in calming the anger of Simon, and in Levi she had a secret ally, for this prophet knew the hiding-place of the sons of the handmaids, and he did not betray it to Simon, lest his wrath be increased at the sight of them. It was also Levi that restrained Benjamin from giving the death blow to the heavily wounded son of Pharaoh. So far from permitting harm to be done to him, he washed his wounds, put him into a chariot, and took him to Pharaoh, who thanked Levi from his heart for his services of loving-kindness. Levi&apos;s efforts were vain, three days later the son of Pharaoh died of the wounds inflicted by Benjamin, and from grief over the loss of his first-born Pharaoh followed him soon after, departing this life at the age of one hundred and seventy-seven years. His crown he left to Joseph, who ruled over Egypt for forty-eight years thereafter. He in turn handed the crown on to the grandchild of Pharaoh, an infant in arms at the time of his grandfather&apos;s death, toward whom Joseph had acted in a father&apos;s stead all his life.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On his death-bed Joseph took an oath of his brethren, and he bade them on their death-bed likewise take an oath of their sons, to carry his bones to Palestine, when God should visit them and bring them up out of the land of Egypt. He said: &quot;I that am a ruler could take my father&apos;s body up to the Holy Land while it was still intact. Of you I do but make the request that ye carry my bones from hence, and you may inter them in any spot in Palestine, for I know that the burial-place of the fathers was appointed to be the tomb only of the three Patriarchs and their three wives.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joseph took the oath, to carry his remains along with them when they left Egypt, from his brethren, and not from his sons, to bury him at once in Palestine, for he feared the Egyptians would not give the latter permission to transport his bones even if they recalled what Joseph had been allowed to do with his father&apos;s body. They would object that Joseph had been the viceroy, and a wish preferred by one of so high an estate could not be denied. Furthermore, he adjured his brethren not to leave Egypt until a redeemer should appear and announce his message with the words, &quot;Pakod--I have surely visited you&quot;--a tradition which Joseph had received from his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">father, who had it from Isaac, and Isaac in turn had beard it from Abraham. And he told them that God would redeem Israel through Moses as through the Messiah, in this world as in the world to come, and the Egyptian redemption would begin in Tishri, when Israel would be freed from slave labor, and would be completed in the following Nisan, when they would leave Egypt.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph also admonished his brethren to walk in the ways of the Lord, so that they might become worthy of His grace and help. Especially he impressed upon his brethren and his sons the virtue of chastity and a steadfast moral life. He told them all that had happened to him, the hatred of his brethren, the persecutions of the wife of Potiphar, the slander, envy, and malice of the Egyptians, to show how that those who fear the Lord are not forsaken by Him in darkness, or bondage, or tribulation, or distress. &quot;I was sold into slavery,&quot; he said, &quot;but the Lord delivered me; I was thrown into prison, but His strong hand helped me. I was tortured by hunger, but the Lord Himself gave me sustenance. I was alone, and God comforted me. And as for you, if ye will walk in the ways of chastity and purity in patience and humility of heart, the Lord will dwell among you, for He loveth a chaste life, and if you, my children, will observe the commandments of the Lord, He will raise you up here, in this world, and bless you there, in the world to come. If men seek to do evil unto you, pray for them, and you will be delivered from all evil by the Lord. On account of my forbearing patience I received the daughter of my master to wife, and her dowry was a hundred talents of gold, and God gave me also beauty like the beauty of a flower, more than all the children of Jacob, and He preserved me unto mine old age in vigor and beauty, for in all things did I resemble Jacob.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph continued and told them the visions he had had, in which the future of Israel was revealed to him, and then he closed with the words: &quot;I know that the Egyptians will oppress you after my death, but God will execute vengeance for your sakes, and He will lead you to the land of promise of your fathers. But ye shall surely carry my bones with you from hence, for if my remains are taken to Canaan, the Lord will be with you in the light, and Behar will be with the Egyptians in the darkness. Also take with you the bones of your mother Zilpah, and bury them near the sepulchre of Bilhah and Rachel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>These words ended, he stretched out his feet, and slept his last eternal sleep, and the whole of Israel mourned him, and the whole of Egypt was in great grief, for he had been a compassionate friend to the Egyptians, too, and he had done good unto them, and given them wise counsel and assistance in all their undertakings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Joseph&apos;s wish, that his bones should rest in the Holy Land, was fulfilled when the Israelites went forth from Egypt, and no less a personage than Moses applied himself to its execution. Such was Joseph&apos;s reward for the devotion he had displayed in the interment of his father&apos;s body, for he had done all things needful himself, leaving naught to others. Therefore so great a man as Moses busied himself with the realization of Joseph&apos;s wish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">For three days and three nights preceding the exodus Moses hunted up and down through the land of Egypt for Joseph&apos;s coffin, because he knew that Israel could not leave Egypt without heeding the oath given to Joseph. But his trouble was in vain; the coffin was nowhere to be found. Serah, the daughter of Asher, met Moses, tired and exhausted, and in answer to her question about the cause of his weariness, he told her of his fruitless search. Serah took him to the Nile river, and told him that the leaden coffin made for Joseph by the Egyptians had been sunk there after having been scaled up on all sides. The Egyptians had done this at the instigation and with the help of the magicians, who, knowing that Israel could not leave the country without the coffin, had used their arts to put it in a place whence it could not be removed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses now took Joseph&apos;s cup, and he cut four flat pieces from it, and engraved a lion on one of them, an eagle on the second, a bull on the third, and a human figure on the fourth. He threw the first, with the lion, into the river, saying at the same time, &quot;Joseph, Joseph, the hour for the redemption of Israel hath arrived, the Shekinah lingers here only for thy sake, the clouds of glory await thy coming. If thou wilt show thyself, well and good; if not, then we are clear from our oath.&quot; But the coffin did not appear.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Moses threw the second plate into the water, that with the figure of the eagle, repeating the same words, but again the coffin did not rise from the bed of the Nile, and there it remained, too, when he threw in the third plate bearing the figure of the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">bull, and called upon Joseph a third time to come forth. But the fourth plate with the human figure and the fourth invocation to Joseph brought the coffin to the surface of the water. Moses seized it, and in joy he bore it off. While Israel had been busy gathering gold and silver from the Egyptians, Moses had been thinking of nothing but Joseph&apos;s coffin, and his happiness was great that he had been permitted to fulfil the wish of Joseph.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">During the forty years of wandering through the desert, the coffin was in the midst of Israel, as a reward for Joseph&apos;s promise to his brethren, &quot;I will nourish you and take care of you.&quot; God had said, &quot;As thou livest, for forty years they will take care of thy bones.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">All this time in the desert Israel carried two shrines with them, the one the coffin containing the bones of the dead man Joseph, the other the Ark containing the covenant of the Living God. The wayfarers who saw the two receptacles wondered, and they would ask, &quot;How doth the ark of the dead come next to the ark of the Ever-living?&quot; The answer was, &quot;The dead man enshrined in the one fulfilled the commandments enshrined in the other. In the latter it is written, I am the Lord thy God, and he said, Am I in the place of God? Here it is written, Thou shalt have no other gods before My face, and he said, I fear God. Here it is written, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, and therefore he did not swear by God, but said, By the life of Pharaoh. Here it is written, Remember the Sabbath day, and he said to the overseer of his palace on Friday, Slay and make ready, meaning for the Sabbath. Here it is written, Honor thy father and thy mother, and he said, when his father desired to send him to his brethren, Here am I, although he knew it was perilous for him to go. Here it is written, Thou shalt not kill, and he refrained from murdering Potiphar when Potiphar&apos;s wife urged him to do it. Here it is written, Thou shalt not commit adultery, and he scorned the adulterous proposals of Potiphar&apos;s wife. Here it is written, Thou shalt not steal, and he stole nothing from Pharaoh, but gathered up all the money and brought it unto Pharaoh&apos;s house. Here it is written, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, and he told his father nothing of what his brethren had done to him, though what he might have told was the truth. Here it is written, Thou shalt not covet, and he did not covet Potiphar&apos;s wife.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>On their arrival in the Holy Land, the Israelites buried the bones of Joseph in Shechem, for God spake to the tribes, saying, &quot;From Shechem did ye steal him, and unto Shechem, shall ye return him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God, who is so solicitous about the dead bodies of the pious, is even more solicitous about their souls, which stand before Him like angels, and do their service ministering unto Him.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jacob raised all his sons in the fear of God, and taught them the ways of a pious life, using severity when there was need to make his lessons impressive. He reaped the fruits of his labor, for all his sons were godly men of stainless character. The ancestors of the twelve tribes resembled their fathers in piety, and their acts were no less significant than those of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Like these three, they deserve to be called the Fathers of Israel. God made a covenant with them as He had made with the three Patriarchs, and to this covenant their descendants owe their preservation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The very names of the tribes point to the redemption of Israel. Reuben is so called, because God &quot;sees&quot; the affliction of His people; Simon, because He &quot;hears&quot; its groaning; Levi, He &quot;joins&quot; Himself unto His people when Israel suffers; Judah, Israel will &quot;thank&quot; God for its deliverance; Issachar, it will be &quot;rewarded&quot; for its suffering with a recompense; Zebulon, God will have a &quot;dwelling-place&quot; in Israel; Benjamin, He swore by His &quot;right hand&quot; to succor His people; Dan, He will &quot;judge&quot; the nation that subjugates Israel; Naphtali, He bestowed the Torah upon Israel, and she drops </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">sweetness like the &quot;honeycomb&quot;; Gad, the Lord gave manna unto Israel, and it was like &quot;coriander&quot; seed; Asher, all nations will call Israel &quot;happy&quot;; and Joseph, because God will &quot;add&quot; a second redemption of Israel to the first--redemption from the wicked kingdom at the end as from Egypt in former times.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not only the names of Jacob&apos;s sons are significant, but the names of their sons as well. Thus the names of the sons of Issachar express the activities of the tribe known for its learning above all the others. The oldest was called Tola, &quot;worm&quot;; as the silk worm is distinguished for its mouth, with which it spins, so also the men of the tribe of Issachar for the wise words of their mouth. The second is Puah, &quot;madder plant&quot;; as this plant colors all things, so the tribe of Issachar colors the whole world with its teachings. The third is Jashub, &quot;the returning one,&quot; for through the teachings of Issachar Israel will be turned back to its Heavenly Father; and Shimron, the fourth, is &quot;the observing one,&quot; to indicate that the tribe of Issachar observes the Torah.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The names of the sons of Gad likewise interpret the history of the tribe. During Israel&apos;s sojourn in Egypt, it had strayed from the right path, but when Aaron appeared as prophet and monitor, and called unto the Israelites to cast away the abominations of their eyes and forsake the idols of Egypt, they hearkened unto his words. Hence the double name Ozni and Ezbon borne by one of the sons of Gad, for this tribe &quot;hearkened&quot; to the word of God, and fulfilled His &quot;will.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The grandsons of Asher bear the names Heber and Malchiel, because they were the &quot;associates&quot; of kings, and their inheritance yielded &quot;royal dainties.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Partly the history of the tribe of Benjamin can be read in the names of its chiefs. It consisted originally of ten divisions, descended from Benjamin&apos;s ten sons, but five of them perished in Egypt on account of their ungodly ways, from which no admonition availed to turn them aside. Of the five families remaining, two, the descendants of Bela and those of Ashbel, had always been God-fearing; the others, the Ahiramites, the Shephuphamites, and the Huphamites, repented of their sins, and in accordance with the change in their conduct had been the change in their names. Ehi had become Ahiram, because the breach with the &quot;Exalted&quot; One was healed; Muppira was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">called Shephupham, because they &quot;afflicted&quot; themselves in their penance; and Huppim was turned into Hupham, to indicate that they had &quot;cleansed&quot; themselves from sin. As a reward for their piety, the family springing from Bela was permitted to have two subdivisions, the Ardites and the Naamites. Their names point them out as men that know well how the fear of God is to be manifested, whose deeds are exceedingly lovely.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Naphtali was another tribe of steadfast piety, and the names of his sons testify thereto: Jahzeel, because the tribesmen raised a &quot;partition wall&quot; between God and the idols, inasmuch as they trusted in God and contemned the idols; Guni, because God was their &quot;protection&quot;; and Jezer and Shillem designate the Naphtalites as men devoted to God with all their hearts.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Two years after the death of Joseph, Reuben fell sick. Feeling that his end was nigh, he called together his sons, his grandsons, and his brethren, to give them his last admonitions from out of the fulness of his experience. He spake: &quot;Hear, my brethren, and do ye, my children, give ear unto Reuben your father in the commands that I enjoin upon you. And, behold, I adjure you this day by the God of heaven that ye walk not in the follies of youth and the fornications to which I was addicted, and wherewith I defiled the bed of my father Jacob. For I tell you now that for seven months the Lord afflicted my loins with a terrible plague, and if my father Jacob had not interceded for me, the Lord had swept me away. I was twenty years of age when I did what was evil before the Lord, and for seven months I was sick unto death. Then I did penance for seven years in the innermost depths of my soul. Wine and strong drink I drank not, the flesh of animals passed not my lips, dainties I tasted not, because I mourned over my sins, for they were great.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">He admonished those gathered around him to beware of the seven tempter spirits, which are the spirit of fornication, gluttony, strife, love of admiration, arrogance, falsehood, and injustice. He cautioned them especially against unchastity, saying: &quot;Pay no heed to the glances of a woman, and remain not alone with a married woman, and do not occupy yourselves with the affairs of women. Had I not seen Bilhah bathe in a secluded spot, I had not fallen into the great sin I committed, for </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">after my thoughts had once grasped the nakedness of woman, I could not sleep until I had accomplished the abominable deed. For when our father Jacob went to his father Isaac, while we sojourned in Eder, not far from Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem, Bilhah was drunken with wine, and she lay asleep, uncovered, in her bedchamber, and I entered in and saw her nakedness and committed the sin, and I went out again, leaving her asleep. But an angel of God revealed my impious act to my father Jacob at once. He came back and mourned over me, and never again did he approach Bilhah. Unto the very last day of his life, I had not the assurance to look my father in the face or to speak to my brethren regarding my disgrace, and even now my conscience tortures me on account of my sin. Nevertheless my father spake words of comfort to me, and prayed to God in my behalf, that the wrath of the Lord might depart from me, as He showed me.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Reuben admonished his children impressively to join themselves to Levi, &quot;because he will know the law of the Lord,&quot; he said, &quot;and he will give ordinances for judgment, and bring sacrifices for all Israel, until the consummation of the times, as the anointed high priest of whom the Lord spake.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After announcing his last will to his sons, Reuben departed this life at the age of one hundred and twenty-five years. His body was laid in a coffin until his sons bore it away from Egypt, and carried it up to Hebron, where they buried it in the Double Cave.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_mzoqlqam4sfh"/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Haggada -</text:span>Simon&apos;s Admonition Against Envy</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As Reuben confessed his sin upon his death-bed, and warned his children and his family to be on their guard against unchastity, the vice that had brought about his fall, so Simon, when he was about to die, assembled his sons around him, and confessed the sin he had committed. He had been guilty of boundless envy of Joseph, and he spoke: &quot;I was the second son begotten by my father Jacob, and my mother Leah called me Simon, because the Lord had heard her prayer. I waxed strong, and shrank from no manner of deed, and I was afraid of naught, for my heart was hard, and my liver unyielding, and my bowels without mercy. And in the days of my youth I was jealous of Joseph, for our father loved him more than all the rest of us, and I resolved to kill him. For the prince of temptation sent the spirit of jealousy to take possession of me, and it blinded me so that I did not consider Joseph to be </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">my brother, and I spared not even my father Jacob. But his God and the God of his fathers sent His angel and saved him out of my hands.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When I went to Shechem to fetch ointment for the herds, and Reuben was in Dothan, where all our supplies and stores were kept, our brother Judah sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites. On his return, when he heard what had happened, Reuben was very sad, for he had been desirous of saving Joseph and bringing him back to our father. But as for me, my wrath was enkindled against Judah, that he had let him escape alive. My anger abode with me all of five months. But the Lord restrained me from using the power of my hands, for my right hand withered for the length of seven days. Then I knew that what had happened was for the sake of Joseph. I repented and prayed to God to restore my hand and withhold me henceforth from all sorts of defilement, envy, and folly. For two years I gave myself up to fasting and the fear of God, for I perceived that redemption from jealousy could come only through the fear of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">My father, seeing me downcast, asked to know the cause of my sadness, and I replied that I was suffering with my liver, but in truth I was mourning more than all my brethren, seeing that I had been the cause of Joseph&apos;s sale. And when we went down into Egypt, and Joseph bound me as a spy, I was not grieved, for I knew in my heart that my suffering was just retribution. But Joseph was good, the spirit of God dwelt within him. Compassionate and merciful as he was, he bore me no resentment for my evil deeds toward him, but he loved me with the same love he showed the others. He paid due honor to us all, and gave us gold, and cattle, and produce. And now, my dear children, do ye love one another, each one his brother, with a clean heart, and remove the spirit of jealousy from the midst of you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Like Reuben, so also Simon adjured his sons to beware of unchastity, for this vice is the mother of all evil. It separates man from God, and abandons him to Behar. These were the closing words of his exhortation: &quot;In the writings of Enoch I saw that your sons would be corrupted through unchastity, and they would maltreat the sons of Levi with the sword. But they will not be able to do aught against Levi, for the war he will wage is the war of the Lord, and he will vanquish all your armies. As a small remnant you will be scattered among Levi and Judah, and none among you will rise to be a judge or a king of our people, as, my father Jacob prophesied in his blessing.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Having completed his admonitions to his sons, Simon passed away and was gathered to his fathers, at the age of one hundred and twenty years. His sons placed him in a coffin made of imperishable wood, so that they might carry his bones to Hebron, as they did, in secret, during the war between the Egyptians and the Canaanites. Thus did all the tribes during the war; they took the remains each of its founder from Egypt to Hebron. Only the bones of Joseph remained in Egypt until the Israelites went out of the land, for the Egyptians guarded them in their royal treasure chambers. Their magicians had warned them that whenever Joseph&apos;s bones should be removed from Egypt, a great darkness would envelop the whole land, and it would be a dire misfortune for the Egyptians, for none would be able to recognize his neighbor even with the light of a lamp.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_vi1wefauekpp"/>Haggada - The Ascension Of Levi</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When it was disclosed to Levi that he was about to die, he gathered all his children around him, to tell them the story of his life, and he also prophesied unto them what they would do, and what would happen to them until the judgment day. He spoke: &quot;When we were pasturing the flocks in Abel-Meholah, the spirit of understanding of the Lord came upon me, and I saw all mankind, how they corrupt their ways, and that injustice builds up walls for herself, and impiety sits enthroned upon the towers. And I fell to grieving over the generations of men, and I prayed to the Lord to save me. Sleep enshrouded me, and I beheld a tall mountain, and lo! the heavens opened, and an angel of God addressed me, and said: &apos;Levi, enter!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;I entered the first heaven, and I saw a great sea hanging there, and farther on I saw a second heaven, brighter and more resplendent than the first. I said to the angel, &apos;Why is this so?&apos; And the angel said to me, &apos;Marvel not at this, for thou shalt see another heaven, brilliant beyond compare, and when thou hast ascended thither, thou shalt stand near the Lord, and thou shalt be His minister, and declare His mysteries to men; and of the Lord&apos;s portion shall be thy life, and He shall be thy field and vineyard and fruits and gold and silver.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Then the angel explained the uses of the different heavens to me, and all that happens in each, and he proclaimed the judgment day. He opened the gates of the third heaven, where I beheld the holy Temple, and God seated upon the Throne of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Glory. The Lord spake to me: &apos;Levi, upon thee have I bestowed the blessing of the priesthood, until I come and dwell in the midst of Israel.&apos; Then the angel carried me back to earth, and gave me a shield and a sword, saying, &apos;Execute vengeance upon Shechem for Dinah, and I will be with thee, for the Lord hath sent me.&apos; I asked the angel what his name was, and he replied: &apos;I am the angel that intercedes for the people of Israel, that it may not be destroyed utterly, for every evil spirit attacks it.&apos;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;When I awoke, I betook myself to my father, and on the way, near Gebal, I found a brass shield, such as I had seen in my dream. Then I advised my father and my brother Reuben to bid the sons of Hamor circumcise themselves, for I was quivering with rage on account of the abominable deed they had done. I slew Shechem first of all, and then Simon slew Hamor, and all my other brothers came out and destroyed the whole city. Our father took this in ill part, and in his blessing he remembered our conduct. Although we did a wrong thing in acting thus against his wishes, yet I recognized it to be the judgment of God upon the people of Shechem on account of their sins, and I said to my father: &apos;Be not wroth, my lord, for God will exterminate the Canaanites through this, and he will give the land to thee and to thy seed after thee. Henceforth Shechem will be called the city of imbeciles, for as a fool is mocked at, so have we made a mockery of them.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;When we journeyed to Beth-lehem, and had been abiding there for seventy days, another vision was vouchsafed me, like unto the former. I saw seven men clad in white, and they spake to me, saying: &apos;Rise up, and array thyself in the priestly garments, set the crown of righteousness upon thy head, and put on the ephod of understanding, and the robe of truth, and the mitre-plate of faith, and the mitre of dignity, and the shoulderpieces of prophecy.&apos; And each of the men brought a garment unto me and invested me therewith, and spake: &apos;Henceforth be the priest of the Lord, thou and thy seed unto eternity. And ye shall eat all that is lovely to look upon, and the table of the Lord thy descendants will appropriate for themselves, and from them will come high priests, judges, and scholars, for all that is holy will be guarded by their mouth.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Two days after I was visited by this dream, Judah and I repaired to our grandfather Isaac, who blessed me in accordance with the words I had heard. Jacob also had a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">vision, and he saw, too, that I was appointed to be the priest of God, and through me he set apart a tenth of his possessions unto the Lord. And when we established ourselves in Hebron, the residence of Isaac, our grandfather taught me the law of the priesthood, and admonished me to hold myself aloof from unchastity.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the age of twenty-eight years I took Milcah to wife, and she bore me a son, and I named him Gershom, because we were strangers in the land. But I perceived he would not be in the first ranks of men. My second son was born unto me in my thirty-fifth year, and he saw the light of the world at sunrise, and I beheld him in a vision standing among the proud of the assembly, and therefore I gave him the name Kohath. The third son my wife bore me in the fortieth year of my life, and I called his name Merari, because bitter had been her travail in bearing him. My daughter Jochebed was born in Egypt, when I was sixty-three years old, and I called her thus because I was known honorably among my brethren in those days. And in my ninety-fourth year, Amram took Jochebed to wife, he that was born on the same day with her.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thereupon Levi admonished his children to walk in the ways of the Lord, and fear Him with all their heart, and he told them what he had learnt from the writings of Enoch, that his descendants would sin against the Lord in times to come, and they would suffer the Divine punishment for their transgression, and then God would raise up a new priest, unto whom all the words of the Lord would be revealed. His last words were: &quot;And now, my children, ye have heard all I have to say. Choose, now, light or darkness, the law of the Lord or the works of Beliar.&quot; And his sons made answer, &quot;Before the Lord we will walk according to His law.&quot; Then Levi spake, &quot;The Lord is witness and the angels are witnesses, I am witness and ye are witnesses, concerning the word of your mouth.&quot; And his sons replied, &quot;We are witnesses.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus Levi ceased to admonish his sons. He stretched out his feet, and was gathered unto his fathers, at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, a greater age than any of his brethren attained.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The last words addressed by Judah to his sons were the following: &quot;I was the fourth son begotten by my father, and my mother called me Judah, saying, &apos;I thank the Lord that He hath given me a fourth son.&apos; I was zealous in my youth and obedient to my father in all things. When I grew up to manhood, he blessed me, saying, &apos;Thou wilt be king, and wilt prosper in all thy ways.&apos; The Lord granted me His grace in whatever I undertook, in the field and in the house. I could speed as swiftly as the hind, and overtake it, and prepare a dish of it for my father. A deer I could catch on the run, and all the animals of the valley. A wild mare I could outstrip, hold it, and bridle it. A lion I slew, and snatched a kid from its jaws. A bear I caught by the paw, and flung it adown the cliff, and it lay beneath crushed. I could keep pace with the wild boar, and overtake it, and as I ran I seized it, and tore it to pieces. A leopard sprang at my dog in Hebron, and I grasped its tail, and hurled it away from me, and its body burst on the coast at Gaza. A wild steer I found grazing in the field. I took it by its horns, swung it round and round until it was stunned, and then I cast it to the ground and killed it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah continued and told his children of his heroism in the wars that the sons of Jacob had waged with the kings of Canaan and with Esau and his family. In all these conflicts he bore a distinguished part, beyond the achievements of the others. His father Jacob was free from all anxiety when Judah was with his brethren in their combats, because he had had a vision showing him an angel of strength standing at the side of Judah on all his ways.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Judah did not conceal his shortcomings, either. He confessed how drunkenness and passion had betrayed him first into marriage with a Canaanitish woman, and then into improper relations with his daughter-in-law Tamar. He said to his children:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Do not walk after the desire of your hearts, and vaunt not the valiant deeds of your youth. This, too, is evil in the eyes of the Lord. For while I boasted that the face of a beautiful woman had never allured me in the wars, and reviled my brother Reuben for his transgression with Bilhah, the spirit of passion and unchastity gained possession of me, and I took Bath-shua to wife, and trespassed with Tamar, though she was the affianced of my son. First I said to Bath-shua&apos;s father, &apos;I will take counsel with my </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">father Jacob, to know whether I should marry thy daughter,&apos; but he was a king, and he showed me an untold heap of gold accredited to his daughter, and he adorned her with the magnificence of women, in gold and pearls, and he bade her pour the wine at the meal. The wine turned my eyes awry, and passion darkened my heart. In mad love for her, I violated the command of the Lord and the will of my father, and I took her to wife. The Lord gave me a recompense according to the counsel of my heart, for I had no joy in the sons she bore me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;And now, my children, I pray you, do not intoxicate yourselves with wine, for wine twists the understanding away from the truth, and confuses the sight of the eyes. Wine led me astray, so that I felt no shame before the throngs of people in the city, and I turned aside and went in to Tamar in the presence of them, and committed a great sin. And though a man be a king, if he leads an unchaste life, he loses his kingship. I gave Tamar my staff, which is the stay of my tribe, and my girdle-cord, which is power, and my signet-diadem, which is the glory of my kingdom. I did penance for all this, and unto old age I drank no wine, and ate no flesh, and knew no sort of pleasure. Wine causes the secret things of God and man to be revealed unto the stranger. Thus did I disclose the commands of the Lord and the mysteries of my father Jacob to the Canaanite woman Bath-shua, though God had forbidden me to betray them. I also enjoin you not to love gold, and not to look upon the beauty of women, for through money and through beauty I was led astray to Bath-shua the Canaanite. I know that my stock will fall into misery through these two things, for even the wise men among my sons will be changed by them, and the consequence will be that the kingdom of Judah will be diminished, the domain that the Lord gave me as a reward for my obedient conduct toward my father, for never did I speak in contradiction of him, but I did all things according to his words. And Isaac, my father&apos;s father, blessed me with the blessing that I should be ruler in Israel, and I know that the kingdom will arise from me. In the books of Enoch the just I read all the evil that ye will do in the latter days. Only beware, my children, of unchastity and greed, for love of gold leads to idolatry, causing men to call them gods that are none, and dethroning the reason of man. On account of gold I lost my children, and had I not mortified my flesh, and humbled my soul, and had not my father Jacob offered up prayers for me, I had died childless. But the God of my fathers, the merciful and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">gracious One, saw that I had acted unwittingly, for the ruler of deception had blinded me, and I was ignorant, being flesh and blood, and corrupt through sins, and in the moment when I considered myself invincible, I recognized my weakness.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Judah revealed to his sons, in clear, brief words, the whole history of Israel until the advent of the Messiah, and his final speech was: &quot;My children, observe the whole law of the Lord; in it is hope for all that keep His ways. I die this day at the age of one hundred and nineteen years before your eyes. None shall bury me in a costly garment, nor shall ye cut my body to embalm it, but ye shall carry me to Hebron.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Having spoken these words, Judah sank into death.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Issachar felt his end approach, he summoned his sons, and he said to them: &quot;Hearken, my children, unto your father Issachar, and listen to the words of him that is beloved of the Lord. I was born unto Jacob as his fifth son, as a reward for the dudaim. Reuben brought the dudaim from the field. They were fragrant apples, which grew in the land of Haran upon an eminence below a gully. Rachel met Reuben, and she took the dudaim away from him. The lad wept, and his cries brought his mother Leah to his side, and she addressed Rachel thus: &apos;Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldst thou take away my son&apos;s dudaim also?&apos; And Rachel said, &apos;See, Jacob shall be thine to-night for thy son&apos;s dudaim.&apos; But Leah insisted, &apos;Jacob is mine, and I am the wife of his youth,&apos; whereupon Rachel, &apos;Be not boastful and overweening. To me he was betrothed first, and for my sake he served our father fourteen years. Thou art not his wife, thou wast taken to him by cunning instead of me, for our father deceived me, and put me out of the way the night of thy nuptials, so that Jacob could not see me. Nevertheless, give me the dudaim, and thou mayest have Jacob for a night.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Then Leah bore me, and I was called Issachar, on account of the reward Rachel had given to my mother. At that time an angel of the Lord appeared to Jacob, and he spoke: &apos;Rachel will bear only two sons, for she rejected the espousal of her husband, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and chose continence! But Leah bore six sons, for the Lord knew that she desired to be with her husband, not because she was prompted by the evil inclination, but for the sake of children. Rachel&apos;s prayer also was fulfilled, on account of the dudaim, for although she desired to eat of the apples, she did not touch them, but put them in the house of the Lord, and gave them to the priest of the Most High that was in those days.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;When I grew up, my children, I walked in the integrity of my heart, and I became a husbandman, cultivating the land for my father and my brethren, and I gathered the fruit from the fields in their due time. My father blessed me, because he saw that I walked in singleness of heart. I was not married to a wife until I was thirty years old, for the hard work I did consumed my strength, and I had no desire unto woman, but, overwhelmed by fatigue, I would sink into sleep. My father was well pleased at all times with my rectitude. If my work was crowned with good results, I brought the firstfruits of my labor to the priest of the Lord, the next harvest went to my father, and then I thought of myself. The Lord doubled the possessions in my hand, and Jacob knew that God aided me for the sake of my singleness of heart, for in my sincerity I gave of the produce of the land to the poor and the needy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;And now hearken unto me, my children, and walk in singleness of heart, for upon it resteth the favor of the Lord at all times. The simple man longeth not for gold, he doth not defraud his neighbor, he hath no desire for meats and dainties of many kinds, he careth not for sumptuous dress, he hopeth not for long life, he waiteth only upon the will of God. The spirits of deception have no power over him, for he looketh not upon the beauty of woman, lest he defile his understanding with corruption. Jealousy cometh not into his thoughts, envy doth not sear his soul, and insatiable greed doth not make him look abroad for rich gain. Now, then, my children, observe the law of the Lord, attain to simplicity, and walk in singleness of heart, without meddling with the affairs of others. Love the Lord and love your neighbors, have pity upon the poor and the feeble, bow your backs to till the ground, occupy yourselves with work upon the land, and bring gifts unto the Lord in gratitude. For the Lord hath </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">blessed you with the best of the fruits of the field, as he hath blessed all the saints from Abel down to our day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Know, my children, that in the latter time your sons will abandon the paths of probity, and will be ruled by greed. They will forsake rectitude and practice craft, they will depart from the commands of the Lord and follow after Beliar, they will give up husbandry and pursue their evil plans, they will be scattered among the heathen and serve their enemies. Tell this unto your children, so that, if they sin, they may repent speedily, and return to the Lord, for He is merciful, and He will take them out to bring them back unto their land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;I am one hundred and twenty-two years old, and I can discern no sin in myself. Save my wife, I have known no woman. I was guilty of no unchastity through the lifting up of eyes. I drank no wine, that I might not be led astray, I did not covet what belonged to my neighbor, guile had no place in my heart, lies did not pass my lips. I sighed along with all that were heavy-laden, and to the poor I gave my bread. I loved the Lord with all my might, and mankind I also loved. Do ye likewise, my children, and all the spirits of Beliar will flee from you, no deed done by the wicked will have power over you, and ye will vanquish all the wild beasts, for ye have with you the Lord of heaven.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And Issachar bade his children carry him up to Hebron, and bury him there by his fathers in the Cave, and he stretched out his feet, and fell into the sleep of eternity, full of years, healthy of limb, and in the possession of all his faculties.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Zebulon attained the age of one hundred and fourteen years, which was two years after the death of Joseph, he called his sons together, and admonished them, in these words, to lead a life of piety: &quot;I am Zebulon, a precious gift for my parents, for when I was born, my father became very rich, by means of the streaked rods, in herds of sheep and herds of cattle. I am conscious of no sin in me, and I remember no wrong done by me, unless it be the unwitting sin committed against Joseph, in that I did not, out of consideration for my brethren, disclose to my father what had </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">happened to his favorite son, though in secret I mourned exceedingly. I feared my brethren, because they had agreed that he who betrayed the secret should be slain with the sword. When they planned to kill Joseph, I besought them amid tears not to sin thus.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;And now, my children, hearken unto me. I exhort you to observe the commands of the Lord, and have mercy upon your neighbors, and act compassionately, not only toward men, but also toward dumb brutes. For on account of my mercifulness the Lord blessed me; all my brethren fell sick at one time or another, but I escaped without any illness. Also the sons of my brethren had to endure disease, and they were nigh unto death for the sake of Joseph, because they had no pity in their hearts. But my sons were preserved in perfect health, as ye well know. And when I was in Canaan, catching fish at the shores of the sea for my father Jacob, many were drowned in the waters of the sea, but I came away unharmed. For ye must know that I was the first to build a boat for rowing upon the sea, and I plied along the coasts in it, and caught fish for my father&apos;s household, until we went down into Egypt. Out of pity I would share my haul with the poor stranger, and if he was sick or well on in years, I would prepare a savory dish for him, and I gave unto each according to his needs, sympathizing with him in his distress and having pity upon him. Therefore the Lord brought numerous fish to my nets, for he that gives aught to his neighbor, receives it back from the Lord with great increase. For five years I fished in the summer, and in the winter I pastured the flocks with my brethren.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Now, my children, have pity and compassion on all men, that the Lord may have pity and compassion on you, for in the measure in which man has mercy with his fellow-men, God has mercy with him. When we came down into Egypt, Joseph did not visit upon us the wrong he had suffered. Take him as your model, and remember not a wrong done unto you, else unity is rent asunder, and the bonds of kinship are torn, and the soul is disquieted. Observe the water! If it runs on undivided, it carries down stone, wood, and sand along with it. But if it is divided and flows through many channels, the earth sucks it up, and it loses its force. If you separate, one from the other, you will be like divided waters. Be not cleft into two heads, for all that the Lord hath made has but one head. He has given two shoulders unto his creatures, two hands, and two feet, but all these organs obey one head.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Zebulon ended his exhortation unto unity with an account of the divisions in Israel, whereof he had read in the writings of the fathers, that they would come about in future days, and bring sore suffering upon Israel. However, he spoke encouraging words to his children, saying: &quot;Be not grieved over my death, and do not lose heart at my departure from you, for I shall arise again in the midst of you, and I shall live joyously among the people of my tribe, those who observe the law of the Lord. As for the godless, the Lord will bring everlasting fire down upon them, and exterminate them unto all generations. Now I hasten hence unto my eternal rest with my fathers. But ye, fear ye the Lord your God with all your might all the days of your life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Having made an end of saying these words, he sank into the sleep of death, and his sons put him into a coffin, wherein they carried him up to Hebron later, to bury him there next to his fathers.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Haggada - Dan&apos;s Confession</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Dan assembled his family at the last of his life, he spake: &quot;I confess before you this day, my children, that I had resolved to kill Joseph, that good and upright man, and I rejoiced over his sale, for his father loved him more than he loved the rest of us. The spirit of envy and boastfulness goaded me on, saying, &apos;Thou, too, art the son of Jacob,&apos; and one of the spirits of Behar stirred me up, saying, &apos;Take this sword, and slay Joseph, for once he is dead thy father will love thee.&apos; It was the spirit of anger that was seeking to persuade me to crush Joseph, as a leopard crunches a kid between its teeth. But the God of our father Jacob did not deliver him into my hand, to let me find him alone, and He did not permit me to execute this impious deed, that two tribes in Israel might not be destroyed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;And now, my children, I am about to die, and I tell it unto you in truth, if you take not heed against the spirit of lies and anger, and if ye love not truth and generosity, you will perish. The spirit of anger casts the net of error around its victim, and it blinds his eyes, and the spirit of lies warps his mind, and clouds his vision. Evil is anger, it is the grave of the soul. Desist from anger and hate lies, that the Lord may dwell among you, and Behar flee from your presence. Speak the truth each unto his neighbor, and you will not fall into anger and trouble, but you will be at peace, and the Lord of peace you will have with you, and no war will vanquish you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;I speak thus, for I know that in the latter days you will fall off from God, and you will kindle the wrath of Levi, and rise in rebellion against Judah, but you will not accomplish aught against them, for the angel of the Lord is their guide, and Israel will perish through them. And if you turn recreant to the Lord, you will execute every kind of evil thing, and do the abominations of the heathen, committing unchastity with the wives of the godless, while the tempter spirits are at work among you. Therefore you will be carried away into captivity, and in the lands of exile you will suffer all the plagues of Egypt and all the tribulations of the heathen. But when you return to the Lord, you will find mercy. He will take you into His sanctuary, and grant you peace.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;And now, my children, fear the Lord, and be on your guard against Satan and his spirits. Keep aloof from every evil deed, cast anger away from you and every sort of lie, love truth and forbearance, and what ye have heard from your father, tell unto your children. Avoid all manner of unrighteousness, cling to the integrity of the law of the Lord, and bury me near my fathers.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the hundred and thirty-second year of his life, Naphtali invited all his children to a banquet. The next morning when he awoke, he told them that he was dying, but they would not believe him. He, however, praised the Lord, and assured them again that his death was due after the banquet of the day before. Then he addressed his last words to his children:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;I was born of Bilhah, and because Rachel had acted with cunning, and had given Jacob Bilhah instead of herself, I was called Naphtali. Rachel loved me, for I was born upon her knees, and while I was still very young, she was in the habit of kissing me and saying, &apos;O that I had a brother unto thee from mine own body, one in thine image.&apos; Therefore Joseph resembled me in all respects, in accordance with Rachel&apos;s prayer. My mother Bilhah was a daughter of Rotheus, a brother of Deborah, Rebekah&apos;s nurse, and she was born the same day as Rachel. As for Rotheus, he was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">of the family of Abraham, a Chaldean, God-fearing, and a free man of noble birth, and when he was taken captive, he was bought by Laban and married to his slave Aina. She bore Rotheus a daughter, and he called her Zilpah, after the name of the village in which he was taken captive. His second daughter he called Bilhah, saying, &apos;My daughter is impetuous,&apos; for hardly was she born when she hastened to suckle.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;I was fleet of foot like a deer, and my father Jacob appointed me to be his messenger, and in his blessing he called me a hind let loose. As the potter knows the vessel he fashions, how much it is to hold, and uses clay accordingly, so the Lord makes the body in conformity with the soul, and to agree with the capacity of the body He plans the soul. The one corresponds to the other down to the third of a hair-breadth, for the whole of creation was made by weight, and measure, and rule. And as the potter knows the use of every vessel he fashions, so the Lord knows the body of His creature, unto what point it will be steadfast in the good, and at what point it will fall into evil ways. Now, then, my children, let your conduct be well-ordered unto good in the fear of God, do naught that is ill-regulated or untimely, for though ye tell your eye to hear, it yet cannot, and as little can ye do deeds of light while you abide in darkness.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Furthermore Naphtali said unto his children: &quot;I give you no command concerning my silver, or my gold, or any other possession that I bequeath to you. And what I command you is not a hard matter, which you cannot do, but I speak unto you concerning an easy thing, which you can execute.&quot; Then his sons answered, and said, &quot;Speak, father, for we are listening to thy words.&quot; Naphtali continued: &quot;I give you no commandment except regarding the fear of God, that you should serve Him and follow after Him.&quot; Then the sons of Naphtali asked: &quot;Wherefore does He require our service?&quot; and he replied, saying: &quot;He needs no creature, but all creatures need Him. Nevertheless He hath not created the world for naught, but that men should fear Him, and none should do unto his neighbor what he would not have others do unto him.&quot; His sons asked again, &quot;Father, hast thou observed that we strayed from the ways of the Lord to the right or to the left?&quot; Naphtali replied: &quot;God is witness, and so am I witness for you, that it is as you say. But I fear regarding future times, that you </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">may depart from the ways of the Lord, and follow after the idols of the stranger, and walk in the statutes of the heathen peoples, and join yourselves unto the sons of Joseph instead of the sons of Levi and Judah.&quot; The sons of Naphtali spoke, &quot;What reason hast thou for commanding this thing unto us?&quot; Naphtali: &quot;Because I know that the sons of Joseph will one day turn recreant to the Lord, the God of their fathers, and it is they that will lead the sons of Israel into sin, and cause them to be driven away from their inheritance, their beautiful land, to a land that is not ours, even as it was Joseph that brought the Egyptian bondage down upon us.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;I will tell ye, my children, the vision I had while I was yet a shepherd of flocks. I saw my brethren pasturing the herds with me, and our father approached, and said: &apos;Up, my sons, each one take what he can in my presence!&apos; We answered, and said to him, &apos;What shall we take? We see nothing but the sun, the moon, and the stars.&apos; Then our father said: &apos;These shall ye take!&apos; Levi, hearing this, snatched up an ox-goad, sprang up to the sun, sat upon him, and rode. Judah did likewise. He jumped up to the moon, and rode upon her. And the other nine tribes did the same, each rode upon his star or his planet in the heavens. Joseph remained behind alone on the earth, and our father Jacob said to him, &apos;My son, why hast thou not done like thy brethren?&apos; Joseph answered, &apos;What right have men born of woman to be in the heavens, seeing that in the end they must stay on earth?&apos; While Joseph was speaking thus, a tall steer appeared before him. He had great pinions like the wings of the stork, and his horns were as long as those of the reem. Jacob urged his son, &apos;Up, Joseph, mount the steer!&apos; Joseph did as his father bade him, and Jacob went his way. For the space of two hours Joseph displayed himself upon the steer, sometimes galloping, sometimes flying, until he reached Judah. Then Joseph unfolded the standard in his hand, and began to rain blows down upon Judah with it, and when his brother demanded the reason for this treatment, he said, &apos;Because thou hast twelve rods in thine hand, and I have but one. Give thine to me, and peace shall prevail between us!&apos; But Judah refused to do his bidding, and Joseph beat him until he dropped ten rods, and only two remained in his clutch. Joseph now invited his brethren to abandon Judah and follow after him. They all did thus, except Benjamin, who stayed true to Judah. Levi was grieved over the desertion of Judah, and he descended from the sun. Toward the end of the day a storm broke out, and it scattered the brethren, so </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">that no two were together. When I gave an account of my vision to my father Jacob, he said, &apos;It is but a dream, it can neither help nor harm.&apos;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;A short while thereafter another vision was revealed to me. I saw all of us together with our father at the shores of the sea, and a ship appeared in the midst of the sea, and it had neither sailors nor other crew. Our father spake, &apos;Do you see what I see?&apos; And when we answered that we did, he commanded us to follow him. He took off his clothes, and sprang into the sea, and we sprang after him. Levi and Judah were the first to scale the side of the ship. Our father cried after them, &apos;See what is written upon the mast,&apos; for there is no ship that does not bear the name of the owner upon the mast. Levi and Judah scrutinized the writing, and what they read was this, &apos;This ship and all the treasures therein belong unto the son of Barachel.&apos; Jacob thanked God for having blessed him, not only on land, but also upon the sea, and he said to us, &apos;Stretch forth your hands, and whatsoever each one seizes shall be his!&apos; Levi caught hold of the big mast, Judah of the second mast, next to Levi&apos;s, and the other brethren, with the exception of Joseph, took the oars, and Jacob himself seized the two rudders, wherewith to guide the ship. He bade Joseph take an oar, too, but he refused to do his father&apos;s bidding, and Jacob gave him one of the rudders. After our father had instructed us each one in what we had to do, he disappeared, whereupon Joseph took possession of the second rudder, too. All went smoothly for a time, as long as Judah and Joseph acted together in harmony with each other, and Judah kept Joseph informed in what direction to steer. But a quarrel broke out between them, and Joseph did not guide the vessel in the way his father had commanded him, and Judah attempted to direct him, and the vessel was wrecked upon a rock. Levi and Judah descended from the masts, and likewise the other brethren left the ship and escaped to the shore. At this moment Jacob appeared, and he found us scattered in all directions, and we reported to him how Joseph had caused the vessel to run aground, because he had refused, out of jealousy of Judah and Levi, to steer it according to their instructions. Then Jacob asked us to show him the spot where we had lost the ship, of which only the masts were visible above the water. He emitted a whistle summoning us all, and he swam out into the water, and raised the vessel as before. Turning to Joseph, he spake thus, &apos;My son, never do that again, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">never permit jealousy of thy brethren to master thee. Nearly it happened that all thy brethren perished because of thee.&apos;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;When I told my father what I had seen in this vision, he clasped his hands, and tears flowed from his eyes, and be said: &apos;My son, for that the vision was doubled unto thee twice, I am dismayed, and I shudder for my son Joseph. I loved him more than all of you, but by reason of his perverseness ye will be carried away into captivity, and scattered among the nations. Thy first and thy second vision had the same meaning, the vision is one.&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Therefore, my sons, I command you not to join yourselves unto the sons of Joseph, but ye shall join yourselves unto the sons of Levi and Judah. I tell you, too, that my inheritance shall be of the best of Palestine, the middle of the earth. You will eat, and the delectable gifts of my portion will satisfy you. But I warn you not to kick in your prosperity and not to become perverse, resisting the commands of God, who satisfies you with the best of His land, and not to forget your God, whom your father Abraham chose when the families of the earth were divided in the days of Peleg. The Lord descended with seventy angels, at their head Michael, and he commanded them to teach the seventy languages unto the seventy families of Noah. The angels did according to the behest of God, and the holy Hebrew language remained only in the house of Shem and Eber, and in the house of their descendant Abraham. On this day of teaching languages, Michael came to each nation separately, and told it the message with which God had charged him, saying: &apos;I know the rebellion and the confusion ye have enacted against God. Now, make choice of him whom you will serve, and whom will you have as your mediator in heaven?&apos; Then spake Nimrod the wicked, &apos;In my eyes there is none greater than he that taught me the language of Cush.&apos; The other nations also answered in words like these, each one designated its angel. But Abraham said: &apos;I choose none other than Him that spake and the world was. In Him I will have faith, and my seed forever and ever.&apos; Thenceforth God put every nation in the care of its angel, but Abraham and his seed He kept for Himself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Therefore I adjure you not to go astray and serve other gods beside Him whom our fathers made choice of. You can perceive somewhat of His power in the creation of man. From head to foot is man wonderfully made. With his ears he hears, with his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">eyes he sees, with his brain he comprehends, with his nose he smells, with the tubes of his throat he utters sounds, with his gullet he swallows food, with his tongue he articulates, with his mouth he forms words, with his hands he does his work, with his heart he meditates, with his spleen he laughs, with his liver he waxes angry, with his stomach he crushes his food, with his feet he walks, with his lungs he breathes, and with his kidneys he makes resolves, and none of his organs undergoes a change in function, each performs its own. Therefore it behooves man to take to heart who it is that hath created him, and who hath developed him from a foul-smelling drop in the womb of woman, who hath brought him to the light of the world, who hath given sight to his eyes, and who hath bestowed the power of motion upon his feet, who maketh him to stand upright, who hath infused the breath of life into him, and who hath imparted of His own pure spirit unto him. Happy the man, therefore, that polluteth not the holy spirit of God within him by doing evil deeds, and well for him if he returns it to his Creator as he received it.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After Naphtali had charged his children thus, and with many other lessons like these, he enjoined them to carry his remains to Hebron, to be buried there near his fathers. Then he ate and drank with rejoicing, covered his face, and died, and his sons did according to all that their father Naphtali had commanded them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the hundred and twenty-fifth year of his life Gad assembled his sons, and he spake to them: &quot;I am the ninth son of Jacob, and I was a valiant shepherd of the flocks. I guarded the herds, and when a lion or any other wild beast approached, I pursued it, gripped it by the foot, flung it a stone&apos;s throw from me, and killed it thus. Once, for a space of thirty days, Joseph tended the flocks with us, and when he returned to our father, he told him that the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah slaughtered the best of the herds, and used the flesh without the knowledge of Reuben and Judah. He had seen me snatch a lamb out of the jaws of a bear, kill the bear, and slaughter the lamb, for it was too badly injured to live. I was wroth with Joseph for his talebearing, until he was sold into Egypt. I would neither look upon him nor hear aught about him, for to our very faces he, blamed us, because we had eaten the lamb without seeking the permission of Judah first. And whatever Joseph told our father, he believed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Now I confess my sin, that ofttimes I longed to kill him, for I hated him from the bottom of my heart, and on account of his dreams I hated him still more, and I desired to destroy him from off the land of the living. But Judah sold him by stealth to the Ishmaelites. Thus the God of our fathers saved him out of our hands, and He did not permit us to commit an abominable outrage in Israel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Hear now, my children, the words of truth, that ye may practice justice and the whole law of the Most High, and permit yourselves not to be tempted by the spirit of hatred. Evil is hatred, for it is the constant companion of deception, it always contradicts the truth. A little thing it magnifies into a great thing, light it takes for darkness, the sweet it calls bitter, and it teaches slander, enkindles anger, brings on war and violence, and fills the heart with devilish poison. I tell you my own experience, my children, that ye may drive hatred out of your hearts, and cleave to the love of the Lord. Righteousness banishes hatred, and humility kills it, for he that fears to give umbrage to the Lord, desires not to do wrong even in his thoughts. This is what I recognized at the last, after I had done penance on account of Joseph, for true atonement, pleasing to God, enlightens the eyes, illumines the soul with knowledge, and creates a counsel of salvation. My penance came in consequence of a sickness of the liver that God inflicted upon me. Without the prayers of my father Jacob, my spirit would have departed from me, for through the organ wherewith man transgresses, he is punished. As my liver had felt no mercy for Joseph, unmerciful suffering was caused unto me by my liver. My judgment lasted eleven months, as long as my enmity toward Joseph.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;And now, my children, each of you shall love his brother, and ye shall uproot hatred from your hearts by loving one another in word and deed and the thoughts of the soul. For I spake peaceably with Joseph in the presence of our father, but when I went out from before him, the spirit of hatred darkened my understanding, and stirred up my soul to murder him. If you see one that hath more good fortune than you, do not grieve, but pray for him, that his happiness may be perfect, and if one of the wicked even should grow rich in substance, like Esau, my father&apos;s brother, do not envy him. Wait for the end of the Lord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;This also tell unto your children, that they shall honor Judah and Levi, for from them the Lord will cause a savior to arise unto Israel. For I know that in the end your children will fall off from God, and they will take part in all wickedness, malice, and corruptness, before the Lord.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After Gad had rested a little while, he spake again, &quot;My children, hearken unto your father, and bury me with my fathers.&quot; Then he drew up his feet, and slept in peace. After five years, his sons carried his remains to Hebron unto his fathers.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the hundred and twenty-fifth year of his life, while be was still robust in health, Asher summoned his children unto him, and admonished them to walk in the ways of virtue and the fear of God. He spake: &quot;Hearken, ye sons of Asher, unto your father, and I will show you all that is right before God. Two ways hath God put before the children of men, and two inclinations hath He bestowed upon them, two kinds of actions and two aims. Therefore all things are in twos, the one opposite to the other. But ye, my children, ye shall not be double, pursuing both goodness and wickedness. Ye shall cling only to the ways of goodness, for the Lord taketh delight in them, and men yearn after them. And flee from wickedness, for thus you will destroy the evil inclination. Heed well the commands of the Lord, by following truth with a single mind. Observe the law of the Lord, and have not the same care for wicked things as for good things. Rather keep your eyes upon what is truly good, and guard it through all the commands of the Lord. The end of man, when he meets the messengers of God and of Satan, shows whether he was righteous or unrighteous in his life. If his soul goes out with agitation, she will be plagued by the evil spirit, whom she served with her lusts and her evil deeds; but if she departs tranquilly, the angel of peace will lead her to life eternal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Be not like Sodom, my children, which recognized not the angels of the Lord, that ye be not delivered into the hands of your enemies, and your land be cursed, and your sanctuary destroyed, and you be scattered to the four corners of the earth, and scorned in the confusion like stale water, until the Most High shall visit the earth, and break the heads of the dragons in the waters. Tell this, my sons, unto your children, that they be not disobedient toward God, for I read in the tablets of the heavens that </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">you will be contumacious and act impiously toward Him, in that you will have no care for the law of God, but you will heed human laws, and they are corrupted by reason of man&apos;s godlessness. Therefore ye will be dispersed abroad like unto Gad and Dan, my brethren, and you will not know either your land, or your tribe, or your tongue. Nevertheless the Lord will gather you in His faithfulness, for the sake of His gracious mercy, and for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And when he had made an end of saying these words, he commanded them to bury him in Hebron. And he sank into sweet sleep, and died. His sons did as he had commanded, and they carried him up and buried him with his fathers.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_kbq4vlw4o35j"/>Haggada - Benjamin Extols Joseph</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Benjamin was one hundred and twenty-five years old, and he called his children to come to him. When they appeared, he kissed them, and spake: &quot;As Isaac was born unto Abraham in his old age, so was I born unto Jacob when he was stricken in years. Therefore I was called Benjamin, &apos;the son of days.&apos; My mother Rachel died at my birth, and Bilhah her slave suckled me. Rachel had no children for twelve years after bearing Joseph. Therefore she prayed to God, and fasted twelve days, and she conceived and bare me. Our father loved Rachel fondly, and he had longed greatly to have two sons by her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;When I came down to Egypt, and my brother Joseph recognized me, he asked me, &apos;What said my brethren to my father regarding me?&apos; And I told him that they had sent Jacob his coat stained with blood, and had said, &apos;Know now whether this be thy son&apos;s coat or not.&apos; And Joseph said: &apos;This is what happened to me. Canaanitish merchantmen stole me away with violence, and on the way they wanted to hide my coat, to make it seem as though a wild beast had met me and slain me. But he who was about to conceal it, was torn by a lion, whereupon his companions, in great fear, sold me to the Ishmaelites. My brethren, thou seest, did not deceive my father with a lie.&apos; In this wise Joseph tried to keep the deed of our brethren a secret from me. He also summoned my brethren, and enjoined them not to make known to our father what they had done to him, and bade them repeat the tale he had told me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Now, my children, love ye the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, and observe His commandments, taking that good and pious man Joseph as your model. Until the day of his death he would not have divulged what his brethren had done to him, and although God revealed their action to Jacob, he continued to deny it. Only after many efforts, when Jacob adjured him to confess the truth, he was induced to speak out. Even then he besought our father Jacob to pray for our brethren, that God account not the evil they had done to him as a sin. And Jacob exclaimed, &apos;O my good child Joseph, thou hast shown thyself more merciful than I was!&apos;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;My children, have you observed the mercy of the good man? Imitate it with pure intention, that ye, too, may wear crowns of glory. A good man has not an envious eye, he has mercy with all, even with sinners, though their evil designs be directed against him, and by his good deeds he conquers the evil, since it was ordained of God. If you do good, the unclean spirits will depart from you, and even the wild beasts will stand in fear of you. The inclination of a good man lies not in the power of the tempter spirit Behar, for the angel of peace guides his soul. Flee before the malice of Beliar, whose sword is drawn to slay all that pay him obedience, and his sword is the mother of seven evils, bloodshed, corruptness, error, captivity, hunger, panic, and devastation. Therefore God surrendered Cain to seven punishments. Once in a hundred years the Lord brought a castigation upon him. His afflictions began when he was two hundred years old, and in his nine hundredth year he was destroyed by the deluge, for having slain his righteous brother Abel. And those who are like unto Cain will be chastised forever with the same punishments as his.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Know now, my children, that I am about to die. Practice truth and righteousness, and observe the law of the Lord and also His commandments. This I bequeath unto you as your sole heritage, and you shall leave it to your children as an eternal possession. Thus Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did, they transmitted it unto us, saying, &apos;Observe the commands of God, until the Lord shall reveal His salvation in the sight of all the heathen.&apos; Then you will see Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob rise up with rejoicing to new life at the right hand of God, and we brethren, the sons of Jacob, will arise also, each of us at the head of his tribe, and we will pay homage to the King of the heavens.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>After Benjamin had made an end of speaking thus, he said: &quot;I command you, my children, to carry my bones up out of Egypt and bury me near my fathers.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And when he had made an end of saying these things, he fell asleep at a good old age, and they put his body into a coffin, and in the ninety-first year of their sojourning in Egypt, his sons and the sons of his brethren brought up the bones of their father, in secret, and buried them in Hebron, at the feet of their fathers. Then they returned from the land of Canaan, and they dwelt in Egypt until the day of the exodus from the land.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">These are the names of the sons of Isra’el who came into Egypt with Ya‘akov; each man came with his household: Re’uven, Shim‘on, Levi, Y’hudah, Yissakhar, Z’vulun, Binyamin, Dan, Naftali, Gad and Asher. All told, there were seventy descendants of Ya‘akov; Yosef was already in Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Yosef died, as did all his brothers and all that generation. The descendants of Isra’el were fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied and grew very powerful; the land became filled with them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now there arose a new king over Egypt. He knew nothing about Yosef but said to his people, “Look, the descendants of Isra’el have become a people too numerous and powerful for us. Come, let’s use wisdom in dealing with them. Otherwise, they’ll continue to multiply; and in the event of war they might ally themselves with our enemies, fight against us and leave the land altogether.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">So they put slavemasters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built for Pharaoh the storage cities of Pitom and Ra‘amses. But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, until the Egyptians came to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">dread the people of Isra’el and worked them relentlessly, making their lives bitter with hard labor — digging clay, making bricks, all kinds of field work; and in all this toil they were shown no mercy.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moreover, the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was called Shifrah and the other Pu‘ah. “When you attend the Hebrew women and see them giving birth,” he said, “if it’s a boy, kill him; but if it’s a girl, let her live.” However, the midwives were God-fearing women, so they didn’t do as the king of Egypt ordered but let the boys live. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and demanded of them, “Why have you done this and let the boys live?” The midwives answered Pharaoh, “It’s because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women — they go into labor and give birth before the midwife arrives.” Therefore God prospered the midwives, and the people continued to multiply and grow very powerful. Indeed, because the midwives feared God, he made them founders of families. Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every boy that is born, throw in the river; but let all the girls live.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_hjisdh4ut4c"/>Haggada - Pharaoh&apos;s Cunning</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The counsellors and elders of Egypt came to Pharaoh, and spake unto him, saying: &quot;Behold, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier than we. Thou hast seen their strong power, which they have inherited from their fathers, for a few of them stood up against a people as many as the sand of the sea, and not one hath fallen. Now, therefore, give us counsel what to do with them, until we shall gradually destroy them from among us, lest they become too numerous in the land, for if they multiply, and there falleth out any war, they will also join themselves with their great strength unto our enemies, and fight against us, destroy us from the land, and get them up out of the land.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The king answered the elders, saying: &quot;This is the plan advised by me against Israel, from which we will not depart. Behold, Pithom and Raamses are cities not fortified against battle. It behooves us to fortify them. Now, go ye and act cunningly against the children of Israel, and proclaim in Egypt and in Goshen, saying: &apos;All ye men of Egypt, Goshen, and Pathros! The king has commanded us to build Pithom and Raamses and fortify them against battle. Those amongst you in all Egypt, of the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">children of Israel and of all the inhabitants of the cities, who are willing to build with us, shall have their wages given to them daily at the king&apos;s order.&apos;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Then go ye first, and begin to build Pithom and Raamses, and cause the king&apos;s proclamation to be made daily, and when some of the children of Israel come to build, do ye give them their wages daily, and after they shall have built with you for their daily wages, draw yourselves away from them day by day, and one by one, in secret. Then you shall rise up and become their taskmasters and their officers, and you shall have them afterward to build without wages. And should they refuse, then force them with all your might to build. If you do this, it will go well with us, for we shall cause our land to be fortified after this manner, and with the children of Israel it will go ill, for they will decrease in number on account of the work, because you will prevent them from being with their wives.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The elders, the counsellors, and the whole of Egypt did according to the word of the king. For a month the servants of Pharaoh built with Israel, then they withdrew themselves gradually, while the children of Israel continued to work, receiving their daily wages, for some men of Egypt were still carrying on the work with them. After a time all the Egyptians had withdrawn, and they had turned to become the officers and taskmasters of the Israelites. Then they refrained from giving them any pay, and when some of the Hebrews refused to work without wages, their taskmasters smote them, and made them return by force to labor with their brethren. And the children of Israel were greatly afraid of the Egyptians, and they came again and worked without pay, all except the tribe of Levi, who were not employed in the work with their brethren. The children of Levi knew that the proclamation of the king was made to deceive Israel, therefore they refrained from listening to it, and the Egyptians did not molest them later, since they had not been with their brethren at the beginning, and though the Egyptians embittered the lives of the other Israelites with servile labor, they did not disturb the children of Levi. The Israelites called Malol, the king of Egypt, Maror, &quot;Bitterness,&quot; because in his days the Egyptians embittered their lives with all manner of rigorous service.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But Pharaoh did not rest satisfied with his proclamation and the affliction it imposed upon the Israelites. He suspended a brick-press from his own neck, and himself took </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">part in the work at Pithom and Raamses. After this, whenever a Hebrew refused to come and help with the building, alleging that he was not fit for such hard service, the Egyptians would retort, saying, &quot;Dost thou mean to make us believe thou art more delicate than Pharaoh?&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The king himself urged the Israelites on with gentle words, saying, &quot;My children, I beg you to do this work and erect these little buildings for me. I will give you great reward therefor.&quot; By means of such artifices and wily words the Egyptians succeeded in overmastering the Israelites, and once they had them in their power, they treated them with undisguised brutality. Women were forced to perform men&apos;s work, and men women&apos;s work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The building of Pithom and Raamses turned out of no advantage to the Egyptians, for scarcely were the structures completed, when they collapsed, or they were swallowed by the earth, and the Hebrew workmen, besides having to suffer hardships during their erection, lost their lives by being precipitated from enormous heights, when the buildings fell in a heap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But the Egyptians were little concerned whether or not they derived profit from the forced labor of the children of Israel. Their main object was to hinder their increase, and Pharaoh therefore issued an order, that they were not to be permitted to sleep at their own homes, that so they might be deprived of the opportunity of having intercourse with their wives. The officers executed the will of the king, telling the Hebrews that the reason was the loss of too much time in going to and fro, which would prevent them from completing the required tale of bricks. Thus the Hebrew husbands were kept apart from their wives, and they were compelled to sleep on the ground, away from their habitations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But God spake, saying: &quot;Unto their father Abraham I gave the promise, that I would make his children to be as numerous as the stars in the heavens, and you contrive plans to prevent them from multiplying. We shall see whose word will stand, Mine or yours.&quot; And it came to pass that the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied, and the more they spread abroad. And they continued to increase in spite of Pharaoh&apos;s command, that those who did not complete the required tale of bricks were to be immured in the buildings between the layers of bricks, and great was the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">number of the Israelites that lost their lives in this way. Many of their children were, besides, slaughtered as sacrifices to the idols of the Egyptians. For this reason God visited retribution upon the idols at the time of the going forth of the Israelites from Egypt. They had caused the death of the Hebrew children, and in turn they were shattered, and they crumbled into dust.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_2mflch8ib7cz"/>Haggada - The Pious Midwives</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When now, in spite of all their tribulations, the children of Israel continued to multiply and spread abroad, so that the land was full of them as with thick underbrush--for the women brought forth many children at a birth--the Egyptians appeared before Pharaoh again, and urged him to devise some other way of ridding the land of the Hebrews, seeing that they were increasing mightily, though they were made to toil and labor hard. Pharaoh could invent no new design; he asked his counsellors to give him their opinion of the thing. Then spake one of them, Job of the land of Uz, which is in Aram-naharaim, as follows: &quot;The plan which the king invented, of putting a great burden of work upon the Israelites, was good in its time, and it should be executed henceforth, too, but to secure us against the fear that, if a war should come to pass, they may overwhelm us by reason of their numbers, and chase us forth out of the land, let the king issue a decree, that every male child of the Israelites shall be killed at his birth. Then we need not be afraid of them if we should be overtaken by war. Now let the king summon the Hebrew midwives, that they come hither, and let him command them in accordance with this plan.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Job&apos;s advice found favor in the eyes of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.&quot; They preferred to have the midwives murder the innocents, for they feared the punishment of God if they laid hands upon them themselves. Pharaoh cited the two midwives of the Hebrews before him, and commanded them to slay all men children, but to save the daughters of the Hebrew women alive,&quot; for the Egyptians were as much interested in preserving the female children as in bringing about the death of the male children. They were very sensual, and were desirous of having as many women as possible at their service.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">However, the plan, even if it had been carried into execution, was not wise, for though a man may marry many wives, each woman can marry but one husband. Thus a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">diminished number of men and a corresponding increase in the number of women did not constitute so serious a menace to the continuance of the nation of the Israelites as the reverse case would have been.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The two Hebrew midwives were Jochebed, the mother of Moses, and Miriam, his sister. When they appeared before Pharaoh, Miriam exclaimed: &quot;Woe be to this man when God visits retribution upon him for his evil deeds.&quot; The king would have killed her for these audacious words, had not Jochebed allayed his wrath by saying: &quot;Why dost thou pay heed to her words? She is but a child, and knows not what she speaks.&quot; Yet, although Miriam was but five years old at the time, she nevertheless accompanied her mother, and helped her with her offices to the Hebrew women, giving food to the new-born babes while Jochebed washed and bathed them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh&apos;s order ran as follows: &quot;At the birth of the child, if it be a man child, kill it; but if it be a female child, then you need not kill it, but you may save it alive.&quot; The midwives returned: &quot;How are we to know whether the child is male or female?&quot; for the king had bidden them kill it while it was being born. Pharaoh replied: &quot;If the child issues forth from the womb with its face foremost, it is a man child, for it looks to the earth, whence man was taken; but if its feet appear first, it is a female, for it looks up toward the rib of the mother, and from a rib woman was made.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The king used all sorts of devices to render the midwives amenable to his wishes. He approached them with amorous proposals, which they both repelled, and then he threatened them with death by fire. But they said within themselves: &quot;Our father Abraham opened an inn, that he might feed the wayfarers, though they were heathen, and we should neglect the children, nay, kill them? No, we shall have a care to keep them alive.&quot; Thus they failed to execute what Pharaoh had commanded. Instead of murdering the babes, they supplied all their needs. If a mother that had given birth to a child lacked food and drink, the midwives went to well-to-do women, and took up a collection, that the infant might not suffer want. They did still more for the little ones. They made supplication to God, praying: &quot;Thou knowest that we are not fulfilling the words of Pharaoh, but it is our aim to fulfil Thy words. O that it be Thy will, our Lord, to let the child come into the world safe and sound, lest we fall under the suspicion that we tried to slay it, and maimed it in the attempt.&quot; The Lord hearkened to their </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">prayer, and no child born under the ministrations of Shiphrah and Puah, or Jochebed and Miriam, as the midwives are also called, came into the world lame or blind or afflicted with any other blemish.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing that his command was ineffectual, he summoned the midwives a second time, and called them to account for their disobedience. They replied: &quot;This nation is compared unto one animal and another, and, in sooth, the Hebrews are like the animals. As little as the animals do they need the offices of midwives.&quot; These two God-fearing women were rewarded in many ways for their good deeds. Not only that Pharaoh did them no harm, but they were made the ancestors of priests and Levites, and kings and princes. Jochebed became the mother of the priest Aaron and of the Levite Moses, and from Miriam&apos;s union with Caleb sprang the royal house of David. The hand of God was visible in her married life. She contracted a grievous sickness, and though it was thought by all that saw her that death would certainly overtake her, she recovered, and God restored her youth, and bestowed unusual beauty upon her, so that renewed happiness awaited her husband, who had been deprived of the pleasures of conjugal life during her long illness. His unexpected joys were the reward of his piety and trust in God. And another recompense was accorded to Miriam: she was privileged to bring forth Bezalel, the builder of the Tabernacle, who was endowed with celestial wisdom.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_rcggwq90wvkf"/>Haggada - The Slaughter Of The Innocents</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Balaam&apos;s advice was accepted by Pharaoh and the Egyptians. They knew that God pays measure for measure, therefore they believed that the drowning of the men children would be the safest means of exterminating the Hebrews, without incurring harm themselves, for the Lord had sworn unto Noah never again to destroy the world by water. Thus, they assumed, they would be exempt from punishment, wherein they were wrong, however. In the first place, though the Lord had sworn not to bring a flood upon men, there was nothing in the way of bringing men into a flood. Furthermore, the oath of God applied to the whole of mankind, not to a single nation. The end of the Egyptians was that they met their death in the billows of the Red Sea. &quot;Measure for measure&quot;--as they had drowned the men children of the Israelites, so they were drowned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Pharaoh now took steps looking to the faithful execution of his decree. He sent his bailiffs into the houses of the Israelites, to discover all new-born children, wherever they might be. To make sure that the Hebrews should not succeed in keeping the children hidden, the Egyptians hatched a devilish plan. Their women were to take their little ones to the houses of the Israelitish women that were suspected of having infants. When the Egyptian children began to cry or coo, the Hebrew children that were kept in hiding would join in, after the manner of babies, and betray their presence, whereupon the Egyptians would seize them and bear them off.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Furthermore, Pharaoh commanded that the Israelitish women employ none but Egyptian midwives, who were to secure precise information as to the time of their delivery, and were to exercise great care, and let no male child escape their vigilance alive. If there should be parents that evaded the command, and preserved a new-born boy in secret, they and all belonging to them were to be killed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Is it to be wondered at, then, that many of the Hebrews kept themselves away from their wives? Nevertheless those who put trust in God were not forsaken by Him. The women that remained united with their husbands would go out into the field when their time of delivery arrived, and give birth to their children and leave them there, while they themselves returned home. The Lord, who had sworn unto their ancestors to multiply them, sent one of His angels to wash the babes, anoint them, stretch their limbs, and swathe them. Then he would give them two smooth pebbles, from one of which they sucked milk, and from the other honey. And God caused the hair of the infants to grow down to their knees and serve them as a protecting garment, and then He ordered the earth to receive the babes, that they be sheltered therein until the time of their growing up, when it would open its mouth and vomit forth the children, and they would sprout up like the herb of the field and the grass of the forest. Thereafter each would return to his family and the house of his father.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the Egyptians saw this, they went forth, every man to his field, with his yoke of oxen, and they ploughed up the earth as one ploughs it at seed time. Yet they were unable to do harm to the infants of the children of Israel that had been swallowed up and lay in the bosom of the earth. Thus the people of Israel increased and waxed </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">exceedingly. And Pharaoh ordered his officers to go to Goshen, to look for the male babes of the children of Israel, and when they discovered one, they tore him from his mother&apos;s breast by force, and thrust him into the river.&quot; But no one is so valiant as to be able to foil God&apos;s purposes, though he contrive ten thousand subtle devices unto that end. The child foretold by Pharaoh&apos;s dreams and by his astrologers was brought up and kept concealed from the king&apos;s spies. It came to pass after the following manner.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Pharaoh&apos;s proclamation was issued, decreeing that the men children of the Hebrews were to be cast into the river, Amram, who was the president of the Sanhedrin, decided that in the circumstances it was best for husbands to live altogether separate from their wives. He set the example. He divorced his wife, and all the men of Israel did likewise, for he occupied a place of great consideration among his people, one reason being that he belonged to the tribe of Levi, the tribe that was faithful to its God even in the land of Egypt, though the other tribes wavered in their allegiance, and attempted to ally themselves with the Egyptians, going so far as to give up Abraham&apos;s sign of the covenant. To chastise the Hebrews for their impiety, God turned the love of the Egyptians for them into hatred, so that they resolved upon their destruction. Mindful of all that he and his people owed to Joseph&apos;s wise rule, Pharaoh refused at first to entertain the malicious plans proposed by the Egyptians against the Hebrews. He spoke to his people, &quot;You fools, we are indebted to these Hebrews for whatever we enjoy, and you desire now to rise up against them?&quot; But the Egyptians could not be turned aside from their purpose of ruining Israel. They deposed their king, and incarcerated him for three months, until he declared himself ready to execute with determination what they had resolved upon, and he sought to bring about the ruin of the children of Israel by every conceivable means. Such was the retribution they had drawn down upon themselves by their own acts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As for Amram, not only did he belong to the tribe of Levi, distinguished for its piety, but by reason of his extraordinary piety he was prominent even among the pious of the tribe. He was one of the four who were immaculate, untainted by sin, over whom </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">death would have had no power, had mortality not been decreed against every single human being on account of the fall of the first man and woman. The other three that led the same sinless life were Benjamin, Jesse the father of David, and Chileab the son of David. If the Shekinah was drawn close again to the dwelling-place of mortals, it was due to Amram&apos;s piety. Originally the real residence of the Shekinah was among men, but when Adam committed his sin, she withdrew to heaven, at first to the lowest of the seven heavens. Thence she was banished by Cain&apos;s crime, and she retired to the second heaven. The sins of the generation of Enoch removed her still farther off from men, she took up her abode in the third heaven; then, successively, in the fourth, on account of the malefactors in the generation of the deluge; in the fifth, during the building of the tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues; in the sixth, by reason of the wicked Egyptians at the time of Abraham; and, finally, in the seventh, in consequence of the abominations of the inhabitants of Sodom. Six righteous men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kohath, and Amram, drew the Shekinah back, one by one, from the seventh to the first heaven, and through the seventh righteous man, Moses, she was made to descend to the earth and abide among men as aforetime.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Amram&apos;s sagacity kept pace with his piety and his learning. The Egyptians succeeded in enslaving the Hebrews by seductive promises. At first they gave them a shekel for every brick they made, tempting them to superhuman efforts by the prospect of earning much money. Later, when the Egyptians forced them to work without wages, they insisted upon having as many bricks as the Hebrews had made when their labor was paid for, but they could demand only a single brick daily from Amram, for he had been the only one whom they had not led astray by their artifice. He had been satisfied with a single shekel daily, and had therefore made only a single brick daily, which they had to accept afterward as the measure of his day&apos;s work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As his life partner, Amram chose his aunt Jochebed, who was born the same day with him. She was the daughter of Levi, and she owed her name, &quot;Divine Splendor,&quot; to the celestial light that radiated from her countenance. She was worthy of being her husband&apos;s helpmeet, for she was one of the midwives that had imperilled their own lives to rescue the little Hebrew babes. Indeed, if God had not allowed a miracle to happen, she and her daughter Miriam would have been killed by Pharaoh for having </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">resisted his orders and saved the Hebrew children alive. When the king sent his hangmen for the two women, God caused them to become invisible, and the bailiffs had to return without accomplishing their errand.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The first child of the union between Amram and Jochebed, his wife, who was one hundred and twenty-six years old at the time of her marriage, was a girl, and the mother called her Miriam, &quot;Bitterness,&quot; for it was at the time of her birth that the Egyptians began to envenom the life of the Hebrews. The second child was a boy, called Aaron, which means, &quot;Woe unto this pregnancy!&quot; because Pharaoh&apos;s instructions to the midwives, to kill the male children of the Hebrews, was proclaimed during the months before Aaron&apos;s birth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Haggada - the Birth Of Moses</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Amram separated from his wife on account of the edict published against the male children of the Hebrews, and his example was followed by all the Israelites, his daughter Miriam said to him: &quot;Father, thy decree is worse than Pharaoh&apos;s decree. The Egyptians aim to destroy only the male children, but thou includest the girls as well. Pharaoh deprives his victims of life in this world, but thou preventest children from being born, and thus thou deprivest them of the future life, too. He resolves destruction, but who knows whether the intention of the wicked can persist? Thou art a righteous man, and the enactments of the righteous are executed by God, hence thy decree will be upheld.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Amram recognized the justice of her plea, and he repaired to the Sanhedrin, and put the matter before this body. The members of the court spoke, and said: &quot;It was thou that didst separate husbands and wives, and from thee should go forth the permission for re-marriage.&quot; Amram then made the proposition that each of the members of the Sanhedrin return to his wife, and wed her clandestinely, but his colleagues repudiated the plan, saying, &quot;And who will make it known unto the whole of Israel? &quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Accordingly, Amram stood publicly under the wedding canopy with his divorced wife Jochebed, while Aaron and Miriam danced about it, and the angels proclaimed, &quot;Let the mother of children be joyful!&quot; His re-marriage was solemnized with great </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">ceremony, to the end that the men that had followed his example in divorcing their wives might imitate him now in taking them again unto themselves. And so it happened.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Old as Jochebed was, she regained her youth. Her skin became soft, the wrinkles in her face disappeared, the warm tints of maiden beauty returned, and in a short time she became pregnant.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Amram was very uneasy about his wife&apos;s being with child; he knew not what to do. He turned to God in prayer, and entreated Him to have compassion upon those who had in no wise transgressed the laws of His worship, and afford them deliverance from the misery they endured, while He rendered abortive the hope of their enemies, who yearned for the destruction of their nation. God had mercy on him, and He stood by him in his sleep, and exhorted him not to despair of His future favors. He said further, that He did not forget their piety, and He would always reward them for it, as He had granted His favor in other days unto their forefathers. &quot;Know, therefore,&quot; the Lord continued to speak, &quot;that I shall provide for you all together what is for your good, and for thee in particular that which shall make thee celebrated; for the child out of dread of whose nativity the Egyptians have doomed the Israelite children to destruction, shall be this child of thine, and be shall remain concealed from those who watch to destroy him, and when he has been bred up, in a miraculous way, he shall deliver the Hebrew nation from the distress they are under by reason of the Egyptians. His memory shall be celebrated while the world lasts, and not only among the Hebrews, but among strangers also. And all this shall be the effect of My favor toward thee and thy posterity. Also his brother shall be such that he shall obtain My priesthood for himself, and for his posterity after him, unto the end of the world.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After he had been informed of these things by the vision, Amram awoke, and told all unto his wife Jochebed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">His daughter Miriam likewise had a prophetic dream, and she related it unto her parents, saying: &quot;In this night I saw a man clothed in fine linen. &apos;Tell thy father and thy mother,&apos; he said, &apos;that he who shall be born unto them, shall be cast into the waters, and through him the waters shall become dry, and wonders and miracles shall be </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">performed through him, and he shall save My people Israel, and be their leader forever.&apos;&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">During her pregnancy, Jochebed observed that the child in her womb was destined for great things. All the time she suffered no pain, and also she suffered none in giving birth to her son, for pious women are not included in the curse pronounced upon Eve, decreeing sorrow in conception and in childbearing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the moment of the child&apos;s appearance, the whole house was filled with radiance equal to the splendor of the sun and the moon. A still greater miracle followed. The infant was not yet a day old when he began to walk and speak with his parents, and as though he were an adult, he refused to drink milk from his mother&apos;s breast.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jochebed gave birth to the child six months after conception. The Egyptian bailiffs, who kept strict watch over all pregnant women in order to be on the spot in time to carry off their new-born boys, had not expected her delivery for three months more. These three months the parents succeeded in keeping the babe concealed, though every Israelitish house was guarded by two Egyptian women, one stationed within and one without. At the end of this time they determined to expose the child, for Amram was afraid that both he and his son would be devoted to death if the secret leaked out, and he thought it better to entrust the child&apos;s fate to Divine Providence. He was convinced that God would protect the boy, and fulfil His word in truth.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_7z04fx9kki82"/>Haggada -moses Rescued From The Water</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Jochebed accordingly took an ark fashioned of bulrushes, daubed it with pitch on the outside, and lined it with clay within. The reason she used bulrushes was because they float on the surface of the water, and she put pitch only on the outside, to protect the child as much as possible against the annoyance of a disagreeable odor. Over the child as it lay in the ark she spread a tiny canopy, to shade the babe, with the words, &quot;Perhaps I shall not live to see him under the marriage canopy.&quot; And then she abandoned the ark on the shores of the Red Sea. Yet it was not left unguarded. Her daughter Miriam stayed near by, to discover whether a prophecy she had uttered would be fulfilled. Before the child&apos;s birth, his sister had foretold that her mother would bring forth a son that should redeem Israel. When he was born, and the house </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">was filled with brilliant light, Amram kissed her on her head, but when he was forced into the expedient of exposing the child, he beat her on her head, saying, &quot;My daughter, what hath become of thy prophecy?&quot; Therefore Miriam stayed, and strolled along the shore, to observe what would be the fate of the babe, and what would come of her prophecy concerning him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The day the child was exposed was the twenty-first of the month of Nisan, the same on which the children of Israel later, under the leadership of Moses, sang the song of praise and gratitude to God for the redemption from the waters of the sea. The angels appeared before God, and spoke: &quot;O Lord of the world, shall he that is appointed to sing a song of praise unto Thee on this day of Nisan, to thank Thee for rescuing him and his people from the sea, shall he find his death in the sea to-day?&quot; The Lord replied: &quot;Ye know well that I see all things. The contriving of man can do naught to change what bath been resolved in My counsel. Those do not attain their end who use cunning and malice to secure their own safety, and endeavor to bring ruin upon their fellow-men. But he who trusts Me in his peril will be conveyed from profoundest distress to unlooked-for happiness. Thus My omnipotence will reveal itself in the fortunes of this babe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the time of the child&apos;s abandonment, God sent scorching heat to plague the Egyptians, and they all suffered with leprosy and smarting boils. Thermutis, the daughter of Pharaoh, sought relief from the burning pain in a bath in the waters of the Nile. But physical discomfort was not her only reason for leaving her father&apos;s palace. She was determined to cleanse herself as well of the impurity of the idol worship that prevailed there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When she saw the little ark floating among the flags on the surface of the water, she supposed it to contain one of the little children exposed at her father&apos;s order, and she commanded her handmaids to fetch it. But they protested, saying, &quot;O our mistress, it happens sometimes that a decree issued by a king is unheeded, yet it is observed at least by his children and the members of his household, and dost thou desire to transgress thy father&apos;s edict?&quot; Forthwith the angel Gabriel appeared, seized all the maids except one, whom he permitted the princess to retain for her service, and buried them in the bowels of the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Pharaoh&apos;s daughter now proceeded to do her own will. She stretched forth her arm, and although the ark was swimming at a distance of sixty ells, she succeeded in grasping it, because her arm was lengthened miraculously. No sooner had she touched it than the leprosy afflicting her departed from her. Her sudden restoration led her to examine the contents of the ark, and when she opened it, her amazement was great. She beheld an exquisitely beautiful boy, for God had fashioned the Hebrew babe&apos;s body with peculiar care, and beside it she perceived the Shekinah. Noticing that the boy bore the sign of the Abrahamic covenant, she knew that he was one of the Hebrew children, and mindful of her father&apos;s decree concerning the male children of the Israelites, she was about to abandon the babe to his fate. At that moment the angel Gabriel came and gave the child a vigorous blow, and he began to cry aloud, with a voice like a young man&apos;s. His vehement weeping and the weeping of Aaron, who was lying beside him, touched the princess, and in her pity she resolved to save him. She ordered an Egyptian woman to be brought, to nurse the child, but the little one refused to take milk from her breast, as he refused to take it from one after the other of the Egyptian women fetched thither. Thus it had been ordained by God, that none of them might boast later on, and say, &quot;I suckled him that holds converse now with the Shekinah.&quot; Nor was the mouth destined to speak with God to draw nourishment from the unclean body of an Egyptian woman.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Miriam stepped into the presence of Thermutis, as though she had been standing there by chance to look at the child, and she spoke to the princess, saying, &quot;It is vain for thee, O queen, to call for nurses that are in no wise of kin to the child, but if thou wilt order a woman of the Hebrews to be brought, he may accept her breast, seeing that she is of his own nation.&quot; Thermutis therefore bade Miriam fetch a Hebrew woman, and with winged steps, speeding like a vigorous youth, she hastened and brought back her own mother, the child&apos;s mother, for she knew that none present was acquainted with her. The babe, unresisting, took his mother&apos;s breast, and clutched it tightly. The princess committed the child to Jochebed&apos;s care, saying these words, which contained an unconscious divination: &quot;Here is what is thine.&quot; Nurse the boy henceforth, and I will give thee two silver pieces as thy wages.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The return of her son, safe and sound, after she had exposed him, was Jochebed&apos;s reward from God for her services as one of the midwives that had bidden defiance to Pharaoh&apos;s command and saved the Hebrew children alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">By exposing their son to danger, Amram and Jochebed had effected the withdrawal of Pharaoh&apos;s command enjoining the extermination of the Hebrew men children. The day Moses was set adrift in the little ark, the astrologers had come to Pharaoh and told him the glad tidings, that the danger threatening the Egyptians on account of one boy, whose doom lay in the water, had now been averted. Thereupon Pharaoh cried a halt to the drowning of the boys of his empire. The astrologers had seen something, but they knew not what, and they announced a message, the import of which they did not comprehend. Water was, indeed, the doom of Moses, but that did not mean that he would perish in the waters of the Nile. It had reference to the waters of Meribah, the waters of strife, and how they would cause his death in the desert, before he had completed his task of leading the people into the promised land. Pharaoh, misled by the obscure vision of his astrologers, thought that the future redeemer of Israel was to lose his life by drowning, and to make sure that the boy whose appearance was foretold by the astrologers might not escape his fate, he had ordered all boys, even the children of the Egyptians, born during a period of nine months to be cast into the water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">On account of the merits of Moses, the six hundred thousand men children of the Hebrews begotten in the same night with him, and thrown into the water on the same day, were rescued miraculously together with him, and it was therefore not an idle boast, if he said later, &quot;The people that went forth out of the water on account of my merits are six hundred thousand men.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark text:name="_r66091bxbw9l"/>Haggada - The Infancy Of Moses</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">For two years the child rescued by Pharaoh&apos;s daughter stayed with his parents and kindred. They gave him various names. His father called him Heber, because it was for this child&apos;s sake that he had been &quot;reunited&quot; with his wife. His mother&apos;s name for him was Jekuthiel, &quot;because,&quot; she said, &quot;I set my hope upon God, and He gave him back to me.&quot; To his sister Miriam he was Jered, because she had &quot;descended&quot; to the stream to ascertain his fate. His brother Aaron called him Abi Zanoah, because his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">father, who had &quot;cast off&quot; his mother, had taken her back for the sake of the child to be born. His grandfather Kohath knew him as Abi Gedor, because the Heavenly Father had &quot;built up&quot; the breach in Israel, when He rescued him, and thus restrained the Egyptians from throwing the Hebrew men children into the water. His nurse called him Abi Soco, because he had been kept concealed in a &quot;tent&quot; for three months, escaping the pursuit of the Egyptians. And Israel called him Shemaiah ben Nethanel, because in his day God would &quot;hear&quot; the sighs of the people, and deliver them from their oppressors, and through him would He &quot;give&quot; them His own law.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">His kindred and all Israel knew that the child was destined for great things, for he was barely four months old when he began to prophesy, saying, &quot;In days to come I shall receive the Torah from the flaming torch.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Jochebed took the child to the palace at the end of two years, Pharaoh&apos;s daughter called him Moses, because she had &quot;drawn&quot; him out of the water, and because he would &quot;draw&quot; the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in a day to come. And this was the only name whereby God called the son of Amram, the name conferred upon him by Pharaoh&apos;s daughter. He said to the princess: &quot;Moses was not thy child, yet thou didst treat him as such. For this I will call thee My daughter, though thou art not My daughter,&quot; and therefore the princess, the daughter of Pharaoh, bears the name Bithiah, &quot;the daughter of God.&quot; She married Caleb later on, and he was a suitable husband for her. As she stood up against her father&apos;s wicked counsels, so Caleb stood up against the counsel of his fellow-messengers sent to spy out the land of Canaan. For rescuing Moses and for her other pious deeds, she was permitted to enter Paradise alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">That Moses might receive the treatment at court usually accorded to a prince, Bithiah pretended that she was with child for some time before she had him fetched away from his parents&apos; house.&quot; His royal foster-mother caressed and kissed him constantly, and on account of his extraordinary beauty she would not permit him ever to quit the palace. Whoever set eyes on him, could not leave off from looking at him, wherefore Bithiah feared to allow him out of her sight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses&apos; understanding was far beyond his years; his instructors observed that he disclosed keener comprehension than is usual at his age. All his actions in his </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">infancy promised greater ones after he should come to man&apos;s estate, and when he was but three years old, God granted him remarkable size. As for his beauty, it was so attractive that frequently those meeting him as he was carried along on the road were obliged to turn and stare at him. They would leave what they were about, and stand still a great while, looking after him, for the loveliness of the child was so wondrous that it held the gaze of the spectator. The daughter of Pharaoh, perceiving Moses to be an extraordinary lad, adopted him as her son, for she had no child of her own. She informed her father of her intention concerning him, in these words: &quot;I have brought up a child, who is divine in form and of an excellent mind, and as I received him through the bounty of the river in a wonderful way, I have thought it proper to adopt him as my son and as the heir of thy kingdom.&quot; And when she had spoken thus, she put the infant between her father&apos;s hands, and he took him and hugged him close to his breast.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses was in his third year, Pharaoh was dining one day, with the queen Alfar&apos;anit at his right hand, his daughter Bithiah with the infant Moses upon her lap at his left, and Balaam the son of Beor together with his two sons and all the princes of the realm sitting at table in the king&apos;s presence. It happened that the infant took the crown from off the king&apos;s head, and placed it on his own. When the king and the princes saw this, they were terrified, and each one in turn expressed his astonishment. The king said unto the princes, &quot;What speak you, and what say you, O ye princes, on this matter, and what is to be done to this Hebrew boy on account of this act?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Balaam spoke, saying: &quot;Remember now, O my lord and king, the dream which thou didst dream many days ago, and how thy servant interpreted it unto thee. Now this is a child of the Hebrews in whom is the spirit of God. Let not my lord the king imagine in his heart that being a child he did the thing without knowledge. For he is a Hebrew boy, and wisdom and understanding are with him, although he is yet a child, and with wisdom has he done this, and chosen unto himself the kingdom of Egypt. For this is the manner of all the Hebrews, to deceive kings and their magnates, to do all things cunningly in order to make the kings of the earth and their men to stumble.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>&quot;Surely thou knowest that Abraham their father acted thus, who made the armies of Nimrod king of Babel and of Abimelech king of Gerar to stumble, and he possessed himself of the land of the children of Heth and the whole realm of Canaan. Their father Abraham went down into Egypt, and said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister, in order to make Egypt and its king to stumble.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;His son Isaac did likewise when he went to Gerar, and he dwelt there, and his strength prevailed over the army of Abimelech, and he intended to make the kingdom of the Philistines to stumble, by saying that Rebekah his wife was his sister.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Jacob also dealt treacherously with his brother, and took his birthright and his blessing from him. Then he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, his mother&apos;s brother, and he obtained his daughters from him cunningly, and also his cattle and all his belongings, and he fled away and returned to the land of Canaan, to his father.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;His sons sold their brother Joseph, and he went down into Egypt and became a slave, and he was put into prison for twelve years, until the former Pharaoh delivered him from the prison, and magnified him above all the princes of Egypt on account of his interpreting the king&apos;s dreams. When God caused a famine to descend upon the whole world, Joseph sent for his father, and he brought him down into Egypt his father, his brethren, and all his father&apos;s household, and he supplied them with food without pay or reward, while he acquired Egypt, and made slaves of all its inhabitnts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Now, therefore, my lord king, behold, this child has risen up in their stead in Egypt, to do according to their deeds and make sport of every man, be he king, prince, or judge. If it please the king, let us now spill his blood upon the ground, lest he grow up and snatch the government from thine hand, and the hope of Egypt be cut off after he reigns. Let us, moreover, call for all the judges and the wise men of Egypt, that we may know whether the judgment of death be due to this child, as I have said, and then we will slay him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Pharaoh sent and called for all the wise men of Egypt, and they came, and the angel Gabriel was disguised as one of them. When they were asked their opinion in the matter, Gabriel spoke up, and said: &quot;If it please the king, let him place an onyx stone before the child, and a coal of fire, and if he stretches out his hand and grasps the onyx stone, then shall we know that the child hath done with wisdom all that he bath done, and we will slay him. But if he stretches out his hand and grasps the coal of fire, then shall we know that it was not with consciousness that he did the thing, and he shall live.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The counsel seemed good in the eyes of the king, and when they had placed the stone and the coal before the child, Moses stretched forth his hand toward the onyx stone and attempted to seize it, but the angel Gabriel guided his hand away from it and placed it upon the live coal, and the coal burnt the child&apos;s hand, and he lifted it up and touched it to his mouth, and burnt part of his lips and part of his tongue, and for all his life he became slow of speech and of a slow tongue.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing this, the king and the princes knew that Moses had not acted with knowledge in taking the crown from off the king&apos;s head, and they refrained from slaying him. God Himself, who protected Moses, turned the king&apos;s mind to grace, and his foster-mother snatched him away, and she had him educated with great care, so that the Hebrews depended upon him, and cherished the hope that great things would be done by him. But the Egyptians were suspicious of what would follow from such an education as his.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At great cost teachers were invited to come to Egypt from neighboring lands, to educate the child Moses. Some came of their own accord, to instruct him in the sciences and the liberal arts. By reason of his admirable endowments of mind, he soon excelled his teachers in knowledge. His learning seemed a process of mere recollecting, and when there was a difference of opinion among scholars, he selected the correct one instinctively, for his mind refused to store up anything that was false.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>But he deserves more praise for his unusual strength of will than for his natural capacity, for he succeeded in transforming an originally evil disposition into a noble, exalted character, a change that was farther aided by his resolution, as he himself acknowledged later. After the wonderful exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, a king of Arabia sent an artist to Moses, to paint his portrait, that he might always have the likeness of the divine man before him. The painter returned with his handiwork, and the king assembled his wise men, those in particular who were conversant with the science of physiognomy. He displayed the portrait before them, and invited their judgment upon it. The unanimous opinion was that it represented a man covetous, haughty, sensual, in short, disfigured by all possible ugly traits. The king was indignant that they should pretend to be masters in physiognomy, seeing that they declared the picture of Moses, the holy, divine man, to be the picture of a villain. They defended themselves by accusing the painter in turn of not having produced a true portrait of Moses, else they would not have fallen into the erroneous judgment they had expressed. But the artist insisted that his work resembled the original closely.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Unable to decide who was right, the Arabian king went to see Moses, and he could not but admit that the portrait painted for him was a masterpiece. Moses as he beheld him in the flesh was the Moses upon the canvas. There could be no doubt but that the highly extolled knowledge of his physiognomy experts was empty twaddle. He told Moses what had happened, and what he thought of it. He replied: &quot;Thy artist and thy experts alike are masters, each in his line. If my fine qualities were a product of nature, I were no better than a log of wood, which remains forever as nature produced it at the first. Unashamed I make the confession to thee that by nature I possessed all the reprehensible traits thy wise men read in my picture and ascribed to me, perhaps to a greater degree even than they think. But I mastered my evil impulses with my strong will, and the character I acquired through severe discipline has become the opposite of the disposition with which I was born. Through this change, wrought in me by my own efforts, I have earned honor and commendation upon earth as well as in heaven.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One day--it was after he was grown up, and had passed beyond the years of childhood--Moses went to the land of Goshen, in which lived the children of Israel. There he saw the burdens under which his people were groaning, and he inquired why the heavy service had been put upon them. The Israelites told him all that had befallen, told him of the cruel edict Pharaoh had issued shortly before his birth, and told him of the wicked counsels given by Balaam against themselves as well as against his person when he was but a little boy and had set Pharaoh&apos;s crown upon his head. The wrath of Moses was kindled against the spiteful adviser, and he tried to think out means of rendering him harmless. But Balaam, getting wind of his ill-feeling, fled from Egypt with his two sons, and betook himself to the court of Kikanos king of Ethiopia.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sight of his enslaved people touched Moses unto tears, and he spoke, saying: &quot;Woe unto me for your anguish! Rather would I die than see you suffer so grievously.&quot; He did not disdain to help his unfortunate brethren at their heavy tasks as much as lay in his power. He dismissed all thought of his high station at court, shouldered a share of the burdens put upon the Israelites, and toiled in their place. The result was that he not only gave relief to the heavily-laden workmen, but he also gained the favor of Pharaoh, who believed that Moses was taking part in the labor in order to promote the execution of the royal order. And God said unto Moses: &quot;Thou didst relinquish all thy other occupations, and didst join thyself unto the children of Israel, whom thou dost treat as brethren; therefore will I, too, put aside now all heavenly and earthly affairs, and hold converse with thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses continued to do all he could to alleviate the suffering of his brethren to the best of his ability. He addressed encouraging words to them, saying: &quot;My dear brethren, bear your lot with fortitude! Do not lose courage, and let not your spirit grow weary with the weariness of your body. Better times will come, when tribulation shall be changed into joy. Clouds are followed by sunshine, storms by calm, all things in the world tend toward their opposites, and nothing is more inconstant than the fortunes of man.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The royal favor, which the king accorded him in ever-increasing measure, he made use of to lighten the burden laid upon the children of Israel. One day he came into the presence of Pharaoh, and said: &quot;O my lord, I have a request to make of thee, and my hope is that thou wilt not deny it.&quot; &quot;Speak,&quot; replied the king. &quot;It is an admitted fact,&quot; said Moses, &quot;that if a slave is not afforded rest at least one day in the week, he will die of overexertion. Thy Hebrew slaves will surely perish, unless thou accordest them a day of cessation from work.&quot; Pharaoh fulfilled the petition preferred by Moses, and the king&apos;s edict was published in the whole of Egypt and in Goshen, as follows: &quot;To the sons of Israel! Thus saith the king: Do your work and perform your service for six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; on it ye shall do no labor. Thus shall ye do unto all times, according to the command of the king and the command of Moses the son of Bithiah.&quot; And the day appointed by Moses as the day of rest was Saturday, later given by God to the Israelites as the Sabbath day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While Moses abode in Goshen, an incident of great importance occurred. To superintend the service of the children of Israel, an officer from among them was set over every ten, and ten such officers were under the surveillance of an Egyptian taskmaster. One of these Hebrew officers, Dathan by name, had a wife, Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan, who was of extraordinary beauty, but inclined to be very loquacious. Whenever the Egyptian taskmaster set over her husband came to their house on business connected with his office, she would approach him pleasantly and enter into conversation with him. The beautiful Israelitish woman enkindled a mad passion in his breast, and he sought and found a cunning way of satisfying his lustful desire. One day he appeared at break of dawn at the house of Dathan, roused him from his sleep, and ordered him to hurry his detachment of men to their work. The husband scarcely out of sight, he executed the villainy he had planned, and dishonored the woman, and the fruit of this illicit relation was the blasphemer of the Name whom Moses ordered to execution on the march through the desert.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At the moment when the Egyptian slipped out of Shelomith&apos;s chamber, Dathan returned home. Vexed that his crime had come to the knowledge of the injured husband, the taskmaster goaded him on to work with excessive vigor, and dealt him blow after blow with the intention to kill him. Young Moses happened to visit the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">place at which the much-abused and tortured Hebrew was at work. Dathan hastened toward him, and complained of all the wrong and suffering the Egyptian had inflicted upon him. Full of wrath, Moses, whom the holy spirit had acquainted with the injury done the Hebrew officer by the Egyptian taskmaster, cried out to the latter, saying: &quot;Not enough that thou hast dishonored this man&apos;s wife, thou aimest to kill him, too?&quot; And turning to God, he spoke further: &quot;What will become of Thy promise to Abraham, that his posterity shall be as numerous as the stars, if his children are given over to death? And what will become of the revelation on Sinai, if the children of Israel are exterminated?&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses wanted to see if someone would step forward, and, impelled by zeal for the cause of God and for God&apos;s law, would declare himself ready to avenge the outrage. He waited in vain. Then he determined to act himself. Naturally enough he hesitated to take the life of a human being. He did not know whether the evil-doer might not be brought to repentance, and then lead a life of pious endeavor. He also considered, that there would perhaps be some among the descendants to spring from the Egyptian for whose sake their wicked ancestor might rightfully lay claim to clemency. The holy spirit allayed all his doubts. He was made to see that not the slightest hope existed that good would come either from the malefactor himself or from any of his offspring. Then Moses was willing to requite him for his evil deeds. Nevertheless he first consulted the angels, to hear what they had to say, and they agreed that the Egyptian deserved death, and Moses acted according to their opinion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Neither physical strength nor a weapon was needed to carry out his purpose. He merely pronounced the Name of God, and the Egyptian was a corpse. To the bystanders, the Israelites, Moses said: &quot;The Lord compared you unto the sand of the sea-shore, and as the sand moves noiselessly from place to place, so I pray you to keep the knowledge of what hath happened a secret within yourselves. Let nothing be heard concerning it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The wish expressed by Moses was not honored. The slaying of the Egyptian remained no secret, and those who betrayed it were Israelites, Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Pallu, of the tribe of Reuben, notorious for their effrontery and contentiousness. The day after the thing with the Egyptians happened, the two </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">brothers began of malice aforethought to scuffle with each other, only in order to draw Moses into the quarrel and create an occasion for his betrayal. The plan succeeded admirably. Seeing Dathan raise his hand against Abiram, to deal him a blow, Moses exclaimed, &quot;O thou art a villain, to lift up thy hand against an Israelite, even if he is no better than thou.&quot; Dathan replied: &quot;Young man, who hath made thee to be a judge over us, thou that hast not yet attained to years of maturity? We know very well that thou art the son of Jochebed, though people call thee the son of the princess Bithiah, and if thou shouldst attempt to play the part of our master and judge, we will publish abroad the thing thou didst unto the Egyptian. Or, peradventure, thou harborest the intention to slay us as thou didst slay him, by pronouncing the Name of God?&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not satisfied with these taunts, the noble pair of brothers betook themselves to Pharaoh, and spoke before him, &quot;Moses dishonoreth thy royal mantle and thy crown,&quot; to which Pharaoh returned, saying, &quot;Much good may it do him!&quot; But they pursued the subject. &quot;He helps thine enemies, Pharaoh,&quot; they continued, whereupon he replied, as before, &quot;Much good may it do him!&quot; Still they went on, &quot;He is not the son of thy daughter.&quot; These last words did not fail of making an impression upon Pharaoh. A royal command was issued for the arrest of Moses, and he was condemned to death by the sword.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The angels came to God, and said, &quot;Moses, the familiar of Thine house, is held under restraint,&quot; and God replied, &quot;I will espouse his cause.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; the angels urged, &quot;his verdict of death has been pronounced--yes, they are leading him to execution,&quot; and again God made reply, as before, &quot;I will espouse his cause.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses mounted the scaffold, and a sword, sharp beyond compare, was set upon his neck ten times, but it always slipped away, because his neck was as hard as ivory. And a still greater miracle came to pass. God sent down the angel Michael, in the guise of a hangman, and the human hangman charged by Pharaoh with the execution was changed into the form of Moses. This spurious Moses the angel killed with the very sword with which the executioner had purposed to slay the intended victim. Meantime Moses took to flight. Pharaoh ordered his pursuit, but it was in vain. The king&apos;s troops were partly stricken with blindness partly with dumbness. The </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">dumb could give no information about the abiding-place of Moses, and the blind, though they knew where it was, could not get to it.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">A man from the family of Levi took a woman also descended from Levi as his wife. When she conceived and had a son, upon seeing what a fine child he was, she hid him for three months. When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket, coated it with clay and tar, put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the riverbank. His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river while her maids-in-attendance walked along the riverside. Spotting the basket among the reeds, she sent her slave-girl to get it. She opened it and looked inside, and there in front of her was a crying baby boy! Moved with pity, she said, “This must be one of the Hebrews’ children.” At this point, his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Would you like me to go and find you one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” Pharaoh’s daughter answered, “Yes, go.” So the girl went and called the baby’s own mother. Pharaoh’s daughter told her, “Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will pay you for doing it.” So the woman took the child and nursed it. Then, when the child had grown some, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter; and she began to raise him as her son. She called him Moshe [pull out], explaining, “Because I pulled him out of the water.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> One day, when Moshe was a grown man, he went out to visit his kinsmen; and he watched them struggling at forced labor. He saw an Egyptian strike a Hebrew, one of his kinsmen. He looked this way and that; and when he saw that no one was around, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. The next day, he went out and saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other. To the one in the wrong he said, “Why are you hitting your companion?” He retorted, “Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? Do you intend to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian?” Moshe became frightened. “Clearly,” he thought, “the matter has become known.” When Pharaoh heard of it, he tried to have Moshe put to death. But Moshe fled from Pharaoh to live in the land of Midyan.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">An angel of God took Moses to a spot removed forty days&apos; journey from Egypt, so far off that all fear was banished from his mind. Indeed, his anxiety had never been for his own person, but only on account of the future of Israel. The subjugation of his people had always been an unsolved enigma to him. Why should Israel, he would ask himself, suffer more than all the other nations? But when his personal straits initiated him in the talebearing and back-biting that prevailed among the Israelites, then he asked himself, Does this people deserve to be redeemed? The religious conditions among the children of Israel were of such kind at that time as not to permit them to hope for Divine assistance. They refused to give ear to Aaron and the five sons of Zerah, who worked among them as prophets, and admonished them unto the fear of God. It was on account of their impiety that the heavy hand of Pharaoh rested upon them more and more oppressively, until God had mercy upon them, and sent Moses to deliver them from the slavery of Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When he succeeded in effecting his escape from the hands of the hangman, Moses had no idea that a royal throne awaited him. It was nevertheless so. A war broke out at this time between Ethiopia and the nations of the East that had been subject to it until then. Kikanos, the king, advanced against the enemy with a great army. He left Balaam and Balaam&apos;s two sons, Jannes and Jambres, behind, to keep guard over his capital and take charge of the people remaining at home. The absence of the king gave Balaam the opportunity of winning his subjects over to his side, and he was put upon the throne, and his two sons were set over the army as generals. To cut Kikanos off from his capital, Balaam and his sons invested the city, so that none could enter it against their will. On two sides they made the walls higher, on the third they dug a network of canals, into which they conducted the waters of the river girding the whole land of Ethiopia, and on the fourth side their magic arts collected a large swarm of snakes and scorpions. Thus none could depart, and none could enter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Meantime Kikanos succeeded in subjugating the rebellious nations. When he returned at the head of his victorious army, and espied the high city wall from afar, he and his men said: &quot;The inhabitants of the city, seeing that the war detained us </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">abroad for a long time, have raised the walls and fortified them, that the kings of Canaan may not be able to enter.&quot; On approaching the city gates, which were barred, they cried out to the guards to open them, but by Balaam&apos;s instructions they were not permitted to pass through. A skirmish ensued, in which Kikanos lost one hundred and thirty men. On the morrow the combat was continued, the king with his troops being stationed on the thither bank of the river. This day he lost his thirty riders, who, mounted on their steeds, had attempted to swim the stream. Then the king ordered rafts to be constructed for the transporting of his men. When the vessels reached the canals, they were submerged, and the waters, swirling round and round as though driven by mill wheels, swept away two hundred men, twenty from each raft. On the third day they set about assaulting the city from the side on which the snakes and scorpions swarmed, but they failed to reach it, and the reptiles killed one hundred and seventy men. The king desisted from attacking the city, but for the space of nine years he surrounded it, so that none could come out or go in.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">While the siege was in progress, Moses appeared in the king&apos;s camp on his flight before Pharaoh, and at once found favor with Kikanos and his whole army. He exercised an attraction upon all that saw him, for he was slender like a palm-tree, his countenance shone as the morning sun, and his strength was equal to a lion&apos;s. So deep was the king&apos;s affection for him that he appointed him to be commander-in-chief of his forces.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the end of the nine years Kikanos fell a prey to a mortal disease, and he died on the seventh day of his illness. His servants embalmed him, buried him opposite to the city gate toward the land of Egypt, and over his grave they erected a magnificent structure, strong and high, upon the walls whereof they engraved all the mighty deeds and battles of the dead king.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now, after the death of Kikanos, his men were greatly grieved on account of the war. One said unto the other, &quot;Counsel us, what shall we do at this time? We have been abiding in the wilderness, away from our homes, for nine years. If we fight against the city, many of us will fall dead; and if we remain here besieging it, we shall also die. For now all the princes of Aram and of the children of the East will hear that our king is dead, and they will attack us suddenly, and they will fight with us until not a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">remnant will be left. Now, therefore, let us go and set a king over us, and we will remain here besieging the city until it surrenders unto us.&quot;</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They could find none except Moses fit to be their king. They hastened and stripped off each man his upper garment, and cast them all in a heap upon the ground, making a high place, on top of which they set Moses. Then they blew with trumpets, and called out before him: &quot;Long live the king! Long live the king!&quot; And all the people and the nobles swore unto him to give him Adoniah for wife, the Ethiopian queen, the widow of Kikanos. And they made Moses king over them on that day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They also issued a proclamation, commanding every man to give Moses of what he possessed, and upon the high place they spread a sheet, wherein each one cast something, this one a gold nose ring, that one a coin, and onyx stones, bdellium, pearls, gold, and silver in great abundance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses was twenty-seven years old when he became king over Ethiopia, and he reigned for forty years. On the seventh day of his reign, all the people assembled and came before him, to ask his counsel as to what was to be done to the city they were besieging. The king answered them, and said: &quot;If you will hearken to my words, the city will be delivered into our hands. Proclaim with a loud voice throughout the whole camp, unto all the people, saying: &apos;Thus saith the king! Go to the forest and fetch hither of the young of the stork, each man one fledgling in his hand. And if there be any man that transgresseth the word of the king, not to bring a bird, he shall die, and the king shall take all belonging to him.&apos; And when you have brought them, they shall be in your keeping. You shall rear them until they grow up, and you shall teach them to fly as the hawk flieth.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">All the people did according to the word of Moses, and after the young storks had grown to full size, he ordered them to be starved for three days. On the third day the king said unto them, &quot;Let every man put on his armor and gird his sword upon him. Each one shall mount his horse, and each shall set his stork upon his hand, and we will rise up and fight against the city opposite to the place of the serpents.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>When they came to the appointed spot, the king said to them, &quot;Let each man send forth his young stork, to descend upon the serpents.&quot; Thus they did, and the birds swooped down and devoured all the reptiles and destroyed them. After the serpents were removed in this way, the men fought against the city, subdued it, and killed all its inhabitants, but of the people besieging it there died not one.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Balaam saw that the city had fallen into the hands of the besiegers, he exercised his magic arts, which enabled him to fly through the air, and he carried with him his two sons, Jannes and Jambres, and his eight brothers, and they all took refuge in Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Seeing that they had been saved by the king, and the city had been taken by his good counsel, the people became more than ever attached to him. They set the royal crown upon his head, and gave him Adoniah, the widow of Kikanos to wife. But Moses feared the stern God of his fathers, and he went not in unto Adoniah, nor did he turn his eyes toward her, for he remembered how Abraham had made his servant Eliezer swear, saying unto him, &quot;Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.&quot; He also remembered what Isaac did when Jacob fled before his brother Esau, how he commanded his son, saying, &quot;Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan, nor ally thyself by marriage with any of the children of Ham, for the Lord our God gave Ham the son of Noah and all his seed as slaves to the children of Shem and Japheth forever.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At that time Aram and the children of the East heard that Kikanos the king of Ethiopia had died, and they rose up against the Ethiopians, but Moses went forth with a mighty army to fight against the rebellious nations, and he subdued them, first the children of the East and then Aram.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses continued to prosper in his kingdom. He conducted the government in justice, righteousness, and integrity, and his people loved and feared him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the fortieth year of his reign, while he was sitting upon his throne one day, surrounded by all the nobles, Adoniah the queen, who was seated before him, rose up, and spake: &quot;What is this thing which you, the people of Ethiopia, have done these many days? Surely you know that during the forty years this man bath reigned over </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">you, he hath not approached me, nor hath he worshipped the gods of Ethiopia. Now, therefore, let this man reign over you no more, for he is not of our flesh. Behold, Monarchos my son is grown up, let him reign over you. It is better for you to serve the son of your lord than a stranger, a slave of the king of Egypt.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">A whole day the people and the nobles contended with one another, whether to pay heed to the words of the queen. The officers of the army remained faithful to Moses, but the people of the cities were in favor of crowning the son of their former lord as king. The following morning they rose up and made Monarchos, the son of Kikanos, king over them, but they were afraid to stretch forth their hand against Moses, for the Lord was with him. They also remembered the oath they had sworn unto Moses, and therefore they did him no harm. Moreover, they gave many presents to him, and dismissed him with great honor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses left Ethiopia, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, it was the time appointed by God in the days of old to bring Israel forth from the affliction of the children of Ham. But fearing to return to Egypt on account of Pharaoh, Moses journeyed to Midian.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One day, as he was sitting by a well, the seven daughters of the priest of Midyan came to draw water. They had filled the troughs to water their father’s sheep, when the shepherds came and tried to drive them away. But Moshe got up and defended them; then he watered their sheep. When they came to Re‘u’el their father, he said, “How come you’re back so soon today?” They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; more than that, he drew water for us and watered the sheep.” He asked his daughters, “Where is he? Why did you leave the man there? Invite him to have something to eat.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moshe was glad to stay on with the man, and he gave Moshe his daughter Tzipporah in marriage. She gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom [foreigner there], for he said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.”</text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="P78" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Jethro</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the city of Midian, named thus for a son of Abraham by Keturah, the man Jethro had lived for many years, doing a priest&apos;s service before the idols. As time went on, he grew more and more convinced of the vanity of idol worship. His priesthood became repugnant to him, and he resolved to give up his, charge. He stood before his townsmen, and said, &quot;Until now I performed your service before the idols, but I have grown too old for the duties of the office. Choose, therefore, whomever you would choose in my place.&quot; Speaking thus, he delivered to the people all the paraphernalia appertaining to the idol worship, and bade them transfer them to the one to whom in their discretion they should entrust his position. Suspecting Jethro&apos;s hidden motives, the people put him under the ban, and none might venture to do him the slightest service. Not even would the shepherds pasture his flocks, and there was nothing for him to do but impose this work upon his seven daughters.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jethro&apos;s transformation from an idolatrous priest into a God-fearing man is conveyed by his seven names. He was called Jether, because the Torah contains an &quot;additional&quot; section about him; Jethro, he &quot;overflowed&quot; with good deeds. Hobab, &quot;the beloved son of God&quot;; Reuel, &quot;the friend of God&quot;; Heber, &quot;the associate of God&quot;; Putiel, &quot;he that hath renounced idolatry&quot;; and Keni, he that was &quot;zealous&quot; for God, and &quot;acquired&quot; the Torah.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In consequence of the hostile relation between Jethro and the inhabitants of the city, his daughters were in the habit of making their appearance at the watering troughs before the other shepherds came thither. But the ruse was not successful. The shepherds would drive them away, and water their own flocks at the troughs that the maidens had filled. When Moses arrived in Midian, it was at the well that he made halt, and his experience was the same as Isaac&apos;s and Jacob&apos;s. Like them he found his helpmeet there. Rebekah had been selected by Eliezer as the wife of Isaac, while </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">she was busy drawing water for him; Jacob had seen Rachel first, while she was watering her sheep, and at this well in Midian Moses met his future wife Zipporah.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The rudeness of the shepherds reached its climax the very day of Moses&apos; arrival. First they deprived the maidens of the water they had drawn for themselves, and attempted to do violence to them, and then they threw them into the water with intent to kill them. At this moment Moses appeared, dragged the maidens out of the water, and gave the flocks to drink, first Jethro&apos;s and then the flocks of the shep-herds, though the latter did not deserve his good offices. True, he did them the service with but little trouble to himself, for he had only to draw a bucketful, and the water flowed so copiously that it sufficed for all the herds, and it did not cease to flow until Moses withdrew from the well, --the same well at which Jacob had met Rachel, his future wife, and the same well that God created at the beginning of the world, the opening of which He made in the twilight of the first Sabbath eve.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jethro&apos;s daughters thanked Moses for the assistance he had afforded them. But Moses warded off their gratitude, saying, &quot;Your thanks are due to the Egyptian I killed, on account of whom I had to flee from Egypt. Had it not been for him, I should not be here now.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Moses Marries Zipporah</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">One of the seven maidens whom Moses saw at the well attracted his notice in particular on account of her modest demeanor, and he made her a proposal of marriage. But Zipporah repulsed him, saying, &quot;My father has a tree in his garden with which he tests every man that expresses a desire to marry one of his daughters, and as soon as the suitor touches the tree, he is devoured by it.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses: &quot;Whence has he the tree?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Zipporah: &quot;It is the rod that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in the twilight of the first Sabbath eve, and gave to Adam. He transmitted it to Enoch, from him it descended to Noah, then to Shem, and Abraham, and Isaac, and finally to Jacob, who brought it with him to Egypt, and gave it to his son Joseph. When Joseph died, the Egyptians pillaged his house, and the rod, which was in their booty, they brought to Pharaoh&apos;s palace. At that time my father was one of the most prominent of the king&apos;s </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">sacred scribes, and as such he had the opportunity of seeing the rod. He felt a great desire to possess it, and he stole it and took it to his house. On this rod the Ineffable Name is graven, and also the ten plagues that God will cause to visit the Egyptians in a future day. For many years it lay in my father&apos;s house. One day he was walking in his garden carrying it, and he stuck it in the ground. When he attempted to draw it out again, he found that it had sprouted, and was putting forth blossoms. That is the rod with which he tries any that desire to marry his daughters. He insists that our suitors shall attempt to pull it out of the ground, but as soon as they touch it, it devours them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Having given him this account of her father&apos;s rod, Zipporah went home, accompanied by her sisters, and Moses followed them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jethro was not a little amazed to see his daughters return so soon from the watering troughs. As a rule, the chicanery they had to suffer from the shepherds detained them until late. No sooner had he heard their report about the wonder-working Egyptian than he exclaimed, &quot;Mayhap he is one of the descendants of Abraham, from whom issueth blessing for the whole world.&quot; He rebuked his daughters for not having invited the stranger that had done them so valuable a service to come into their house, and he ordered them to fetch him, in the hope that he would take one of his daughters to wife.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses had been standing without all this time, and had allowed Jethro&apos;s daughters to describe him as an Egyptian, without protesting and asserting his Hebrew birth. For this God punished him by causing him to die outside of the promised land. Joseph, who had proclaimed in public that he was a Hebrew, found his last resting-place in the land of the Hebrews, and Moses, who apparently had no objection to being considered an Egyptian, had to live and die outside of that land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Zipporah hastened forth to execute her father&apos;s wish, and no sooner had she ushered him in than Moses requested her hand in marriage. Jethro replied, &quot;If thou canst bring me the rod in my garden, I will give her to thee.&quot; Moses went out, found the sapphire rod that God had bestowed upon Adam when he was driven forth from Paradise, the rod that had reached Jethro after manifold vicissitudes, and which he had planted in the garden. Moses uprooted it and carried it to Jethro, who conceived </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the idea at once that he was the prophet in Israel concerning whom all the wise men of Egypt had foretold that he would destroy their land and its inhabitants. As soon as this thought struck him, he seized Moses, and threw him into a pit, in the expectation that he would meet with death there.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And, indeed, he would have perished, if Zipporah had not devised a stratagem to save his life. She said to her father: &quot;Would it were thy will to hearken unto my counsel. Thou hast no wife, but only seven daughters. Dost thou desire my six sisters to preside over thy household? Then shall I go abroad with the sheep. If not, let my sisters tend the flocks, and I shall take care of the house.&quot; Her father said: &quot;Thou hast spoken well. Thy six sisters shall go forth with the sheep, and thou shalt abide in the house and take care of it, and all that belongeth to me therein.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now Zipporah could provide Moses with all sorts of dainties as he lay in the pit, and she did it for the space of seven years. At the expiration of this period, she said to her father: &quot;I recollect that once upon a time thou didst cast into yonder pit a man that had fetched thy rod from the garden for thee, and thou didst commit a great trespass thereby. If it seemeth well to thee, uncover the pit and look into it. If the man is dead, throw his corpse away, lest it fill the house with stench. But should he be alive, then thou oughtest to be convinced that he is one of those who are wholly pious, else he had died of hunger.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The reply of Jethro was: &quot;Thou hast spoken wisely. Dost thou remember his name?&quot; And Zipporah rejoined, &quot;I remember he called himself Moses the son of Amram.&quot; Jethro lost no time, he opened the pit, and called out, &quot;Moses! Moses!&quot; Moses replied, and said: &quot;Here am I!&quot; Jethro drew him up out of the pit, kissed him, and said: &quot;Blessed be God, who guarded thee for seven years in the pit. I acknowledge that He slayeth and reviveth, that thou art one of the wholly pious, that through thee God will destroy Egypt in time to come, lead His people out of the land, and drown Pharaoh and his whole army in the sea.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thereupon Jethro gave much money to Moses, and he bestowed his daughter Zipporah upon him as wife, giving her to him under the condition that the children born of the marriage in Jethro&apos;s house should be divided into two equal classes, the one to be Israelitish, the other Egyptian. When Zipporah bore him a son, Moses </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">circumcised him, and called him Gershom, as a memorial of the wonder God had done for him, for although he lived in a &quot;strange&quot; land, the Lord had not refused him aid even &quot;there.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Zipporah nursed her first child for two years, and in the third year she bore a second son. Remembering his compact with Jethro, Moses realized that his father-in-law would not permit him to circumcise this one, too, and he determined to return to Egypt, that he might have the opportunity of bringing up his second son as an Israelite. On the journey thither, Satan appeared to him in the guise of a serpent, and swallowed Moses down to his extremities. Zipporah knew by this token that the thing had happened because her second son had not been circumcised, and she hastened to make good the omission. As soon as she sprinkled the blood of the circumcision on her husband&apos;s feet, a heavenly voice was heard to cry to the serpent, commanding him, &quot;Spew him out!&quot; and Moses came forth and stood upon his feet. Thus Zipporah saved Moses&apos; life twice, first from the pit and then from the serpent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses arrived in Egypt, he was approached by Dathan and Abiram, the leaders of the Israelites, and they spake: &quot;Comest thou hither to slay us, or dost thou purpose to do the same with us as thou didst with the Egyptian?&quot; This drove Moses straightway back to Midian, and there he remained two years more, until God revealed Himself at Horeb, and said to him, &quot;Go and bring forth My children out of the land of Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Faithful Shepherd</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Jethro bestowed his daughter Zipporah upon Moses as his wife, he said to his future son-in-law: &quot;I know that thy father Jacob took his wives, the daughters of Laban, and went away with them against their father&apos;s will. Now take an oath that thou wilt not do the same unto me,&quot; and Moses swore not to leave him without his consent, and he remained with Jethro, who made him the shepherd of his flocks. By the way he tended the sheep, God saw his fitness to be the shepherd of His people, for God never gives an exalted office to a man until He has tested him in little things. Thus Moses and David were tried as shepherds of flocks, and only after they had proved their ability as such, He gave them dominion over men.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses watched over the flocks with loving care. He led the young animals to pasture first, that they might have the tender, juicy grass for their food; the somewhat older animals he led forth next, and allowed them to graze off the herbs suitable for them; and finally came the vigorous ones that had attained their full growth, and to them he gave the hard grass that was left, which the others could not eat, but which afforded good food for them. Then spake God, &quot;He that understandeth how to pasture sheep, providing for each what is good for it, he shall pasture My people.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Once a kid escaped from the flock, and when Moses followed it, he saw how it stopped at all the water courses, and he said to it: &quot;Poor kid, I knew not that thou wast thirsty, and wast running after water! Thou art weary, I ween,&quot; and he carried it back to the herd on his shoulder. Then said God: &quot;Thou hast compassion with a flock belonging to a man of flesh and blood! As thou livest, thou shalt pasture Israel, My flock.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not only did Moses take heed that no harm should come to the herds under his charge, but he was also careful that they cause no injury to men. He always chose an open meadow as his pasturing place, to prevent his sheep from grazing in private estates.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Jethro had no reason to be dissatisfied with the services rendered to him by his son-in-law. During the forty years Moses acted as his shepherd not one sheep was attacked by wild beasts, and the herds multiplied to an incredible degree. Once he drove the sheep about in the desert for forty days, without finding a pasturing place for them. Nevertheless he did not lose a single sheep.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses&apos; longing for the desert was irresistible. His prophetic spirit caused him to foresee that his own greatness and the greatness of Israel would manifest themselves there. In the desert God&apos;s wonders would appear, though it would be at the same time the grave of the human herd to be entrusted to him in the future, and also his own last resting-place. Thus he had a presentiment at the very beginning of his career that the desert would be the scene of his activity, which not only came true in the present order of things, but also will be true in the latter days, when he will </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">appear in the desert again, to lead into the promised land the generation, arisen from their graves, that he brought forth from Egyptian bondage.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Wandering through the desert, he reached Mount Horeb, which is called by six names, each conveying one of its distinctions. It is &quot;the mountain of God,&quot; wherein the Lord revealed His law; &quot;Basban,&quot; for God &quot;came there&quot;; &quot;a mountain of humps,&quot; for the Lord declared all the other mountains unfit for the revelation, as &quot;crookbackt&quot; animals are declared unfit for sacrifices; &quot;mountain of abode,&quot; because it is the mountain that God desired for His &quot;abode&quot;; Sinai, because the &quot;hatred&quot; of God against the heathen began at the time when Israel received the law thereon; and Horeb, &quot;sword,&quot; because there the sword of the law was drawn upon the sinners.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now Moshe was tending the sheep of Yitro his father-in-law, the priest of Midyan. Leading the flock to the far side of the desert, he came to the mountain of God, to Horev. The angel of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> appeared to him in a fire blazing from the middle of a bush. He looked and saw that although the bush was flaming with fire, yet the bush was not being burned up. Moshe said, “I’m going to go over and see this amazing sight and find out why the bush isn’t being burned up.” When </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> saw that he had gone over to see, God called to him from the middle of the bush, “Moshe! Moshe!” He answered, “Here I am.” He said, “Don’t come any closer! Take your sandals off your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground. I am the God of your father,” he continued, “the God of Avraham, the God of Yitz’chak and the God of Ya‘akov.” Moshe covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said, “I have seen how my people are being oppressed in Egypt and heard their cry for release from their slavemasters, because I know their pain. I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that country to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the place of the Kena‘ani, Hitti, Emori, P’rizi, Hivi and Y’vusi. Yes, the cry of the people of Isra’el has come to me, and I have seen how terribly the Egyptians oppress them. Therefore, now, come; and I will send you to Pharaoh; so that you can lead my people, the descendants of Isra’el, out of Egypt.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Moshe said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the people of Isra’el out of Egypt?” He replied, “I will surely be with you.

In this way you will plunder the Egyptians.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Burning Thorn-bush</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Moses drew near to Mount Horeb, he was aware at once that it was a holy place, for he noticed that passing birds did not alight upon it. At his approach the mountain began to move, as though to go forward and meet him, and it settled back </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">into quietude only when his foot rested upon it. The first thing Moses noticed was the wonderful burning bush, the upper part of which was a blazing flame, neither consuming the bush, nor preventing it from bearing blossoms as it burnt, for the celestial fire has three peculiar qualities: it produces blossoms, it does not consume the object around which it plays, and it is black of color. The fire that Moses saw in the bush was the appearance of the angel Michael, who had descended as the forerunner of the Shekinah herself to come down presently. It was the wish of God to hold converse with Moses, who, however, was not inclined to permit any interruption of the work under his charge. Therefore God startled him with the wonderful phenomenon of the burning thorn-bush. That brought Moses to a stop, and then God spoke with him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">There were good reasons for selecting the thorn-bush as the vessel for a Divine vision. It was &quot;clean,&quot; for the heathen could not use it to make idols. God&apos;s choosing to dwell in the stunted thorn-bush conveyed the knowledge to Moses that He suffers along with Israel. Furthermore, Moses was taught that there is nothing in nature, not even the insignificant thorn-bush, that can exist without the presence of the Shekinah. Besides, the thorn-bush may be taken as the symbol for Israel in several respects. As the thorn-bush is the lowliest of all species of trees, so the condition of Israel in the exile is the lowliest as compared with that of all the other nations, but as the thorn-bush releases no bird that alights upon it without lacerating its wings, so the nations that subjugate Israel will be punished. Also, as a garden hedge is made of the thorn-bush, so Israel forms the hedge for the world, the garden of God, for without Israel the world could not endure. Furthermore, as the thorn-bush bears thorns and roses alike, so Israel has pious and impious members, and as the thorn-bush requires ample water for its growth, so Israel can prosper only through the Torah, the celestial water. And the thorn-bush, the leaf of which consists of five leaflets, was to indicate to Moses that God had resolved to redeem Israel only for the sake of the merits of five pious men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, and Moses. The numbers represented by the letters composing the Hebrew word for thorn-bush, Seneh, add up to one hundred and twenty, to convey that Moses would reach the age of one hundred and twenty years, and that the Shekinah would rest on Mount Horeb for one hundred and twenty days. Finally, in order to give Moses an illustration of His </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">modesty, God descended from the exalted heavens and spake to him from a lowly thorn-bush instead of the summit of a lofty mountain or the top of a stately cedar tree.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Ascension Of Moses</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The vision of the burning bush appeared to Moses alone; the other shepherds with him saw nothing of it. He took five steps in the direction of the bush, to view it at close range, and when God beheld the countenance of Moses distorted by grief and anxiety over Israel&apos;s suffering, He spake, &quot;This one is worthy of the office of pasturing My people.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses was still a novice in prophecy, therefore God said to Himself, &quot;If I reveal Myself to him in loud tones, I shall alarm him, but if I reveal Myself with a subdued voice, he will hold prophecy in low esteem,&quot; whereupon he addressed him in his father Amram&apos;s voice. Moses was overjoyed to hear his father speak, for it gave him the assurance that. he was still alive. The voice called his name twice, and he answered, &quot;Here am I! What is my father&apos;s wish?&quot; God replied, saying, &quot;I am not thy father. I but desired to refrain from terrifying thee, therefore I spoke with thy father&apos;s voice. I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&quot; These words rejoiced Moses greatly, for not only was his father Amram&apos;s name pronounced in the same breath with the names of the three Patriarchs, but it came before theirs, as though he ranked higher than they.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses said not a word. In silent reverence before the Divine vision he covered his face, and when God disclosed the mission with which He charged him, of bringing the Israelites forth from the land of Egypt, he answered with humility, &quot;Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?&quot; Thereupon spake God, &quot;Moses, thou art meek, and I will reward thee for thy modesty. I will deliver the whole land of Egypt into thine hand, and, besides, I will let thee ascend unto the throne of My glory, and look upon all the angels of the heavens.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Hereupon God commanded Metatron, the Angel of the Face, to conduct Moses to the celestial regions amid the sound of music and song, and He commanded him furthermore to summon thirty thousand angels, to serve as his body-guard, fifteen </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">thousand to right of him and fifteen thousand to left of him. In abject terror Moses asked Metatron, &quot;Who art thou?&quot; and the angel replied, &quot;I am Enoch, the son of Jared, thy ancestor, and God has charged me to accompany thee to His throne.&quot; But Moses demurred, saying, &quot;I am but flesh and blood, and I cannot look upon the countenance of an angel,&quot; whereupon Metatron changed Moses&apos; flesh into torches of fire, his eyes into Merkabah wheels, his strength into an angel&apos;s, and his tongue into a flame, and he took him to heaven with a retinue of thirty thousand angels, one half moving to right of them and one half to left of them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the first heaven Moses saw streams upon streams of water, and he observed that the whole heaven consisted of windows, at each of which angels were stationed. Metatron named and pointed out all the windows of heaven to him: the window of prayer and the window of supplication; of weeping and of joy; plenitude and starvation; wealth and poverty; war and peace; conception and birth; showers and soft rains; sin and repentance; life and death; pestilence and healing; sickness and health; and many windows more.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the second heaven Moses saw the angel Nuriel, standing three hundred parasangs high, with his retinue of fifty myriads of angels, all fashioned out of water and fire, and all keeping their faces turned toward the Shekinah while they sang a song of praise to God. Metatron explained to Moses, that these were the angels set over the clouds, the winds, and the rains, who return speedily, as soon as they have executed the will of their Creator, to their station in the second of the heavens, there to proclaim the praise of God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the third heaven Moses saw an angel, so tall it would take a human being five hundred years to climb to his height. He had seventy thousand heads, each head having as many mouths, each mouth as many tongues, and each tongue as many sayings, and he together with his suite of seventy thousand myriads of angels made of white fire praised and extolled the Lord. &quot;These,&quot; said Metatron to Moses, &quot;are called Erelim, and they are appointed over the grass, the trees, the fruits, and the grain, but as soon as they have done the will of their Creator, they return to the place assigned to them, and praise God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>In the fourth heaven Moses saw a Temple, the pillars thereof made of red fire, the staves of green fire, the thresholds of white fire, the boards and clasps of flaming fire, the gates of carbuncles, and the pinnacles of rubies. Angels were entering the Temple and giving praise to God there. In response to a question from Moses Metatron told him that they presided over the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the other celestial bodies. and all of them intone songs before God. In this heaven Moses noticed also the two great planets, Venus and Mars, each as large as the whole earth, and concerning these he asked unto what purpose they had been created. Metatron explained thereupon, that Venus lies upon the sun to cool him off in summer, else he would scorch the earth, and Mars lies upon the moon, to impart warmth to her, lest she freeze the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Arrived in the fifth heaven, Moses saw hosts of angels, whose nether parts were of snow and their upper parts of fire, and yet the snow did not melt nor was the fire extinguished, for God had established perfect harmony between the two elements. These angels, called Ishim, have had nothing to do since the day of their creation but praise and extol the Lord.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the sixth of the heavens were millions and myriads of angels praising God, they were called &apos;Irin and kadishim, &quot;Watchers&quot; and &quot;Holy Ones,&quot; and their chief was made of hail, and he was so tall, it would take five hundred years to walk a distance equal to his height.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, &quot;Anger,&quot; and Hemah, &quot;Wrath,&quot; whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, &quot;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,&quot; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. &quot;This one,&quot; said Metatron, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">addressing Moses, &quot;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.&quot; &quot;Whither goes he now?&quot; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, &quot;To fetch the soul of Job the pious.&quot; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, &quot;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Here, in the highest heaven, he saw also the seraphim with their six wings. With two they cover their face, that they gaze not upon the Shekinah; and with two their feet, which, being like a calf&apos;s feet, they hide, to keep secret Israel&apos;s transgression of the golden calf. With the third pair of wings they fly and do the service of the Lord, all the while exclaiming, &quot;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.&quot; The wings of these angels are of prodigious size, it would take a man five hundred years to traverse their length and their breadth, as from one end of the earth to the other.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And Moses saw in the seventh heaven the holy Hayyot, which support the throne of God; and he beheld also the angel Zagzagel, the prince of the Torah and of wisdom, who teaches the Torah in seventy languages to the souls of men, and thereafter they cherish the precepts contained therein as laws revealed by God to Moses on Sinai. From this angel with the horns of glory Moses himself learnt all the ten mysteries.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Having seen what there is in the seven heavens, he spoke to God, saying, &quot;I will not leave the heavens unless Thou grantest me a gift,&quot; and God replied, &quot;I will give thee the Torah, and men shall call it the Law of Moses.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Moses Visits Paradise And Hell</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses was on the point of departing from heaven, a celestial voice announced: &quot;Moses, thou camest hither, and thou didst see the throne of My glory. Now thou shalt see also Paradise and hell,&quot; and God dispatched Gabriel on the errand of showing hell to him. Terrified by its fires, when he caught sight of them as he entered the portals of hell, Moses refused to go farther. But the angel encouraged him, saying, &quot;There is a fire that not only burns but also consumes, and that fire will protect thee against hell fire, so that thou canst step upon it, and yet thou wilt not be seared.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>As Moses entered hell, the fire withdrew a distance of five hundred parasangs, and the Angel of Hell, Nasargiel, asked him, &quot;Who art thou?&quot; and he answered, &quot;I am Moses, the son of Amram.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Nasargiel: &quot;This is not thy place, thou belongest in Paradise.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses: &quot;I came hither to see the manifestation of the power of God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then said God to the Angel of Hell, &quot;Go and show hell unto Moses, and how the wicked are treated there.&quot; Immediately he went with Moses, walking before him like a pupil before his master, and thus they entered hell together, and Moses saw men undergoing torture by the Angels of Destruction: some of the sinners were suspended by their eyelids, some by their ears, some by their hands, and some by their tongues, and they cried bitterly. And women were suspended by their hair and by their breasts, and in other ways, all on chains of fire. Nasargiel explained: &quot;These hang by their eyes, because they looked lustfully upon the wives of their neighbors, and with a covetous eye upon the possessions of their fellow-men. These hang by their ears because they listened to empty and vain speech, and turned their ear away from hearing the Torah. These hang by their tongues, because they talked slander, and accustomed their tongue to foolish babbling. These hang by their feet, because they walked with them in order to spy upon their fellow-men, but they walked not to the synagogue, to offer prayer unto their Creator. These hang by their hands, because with them they robbed their neighbors of their possessions, and committed murder. These women hang by their hair and their breasts, because they uncovered them in the presence of young men, so that they conceived desire unto them, and fell into sin.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses heard hell cry with a loud and a bitter cry, saying to Nasargiel: &quot;Give me something to eat, I am hungry.&quot;--Nasargiel: &quot;What shall I give thee?&quot;--Hell: &quot;Give me the souls of the pious.&quot;--Nasargiel: &quot;The Holy One, blessed be He, will not deliver the souls of the pious unto thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses saw the place called Alukah, where sinners were suspended by their feet, their heads downward, and their bodies covered with black worms, each five hundred </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">parasangs long. They lamented, and cried: &quot;Woe unto us for the punishment of hell. Give us death, that we may die!&quot; Nasargiel explained: &quot;These are the sinners that swore falsely, profaned the Sabbath and the holy days, despised the sages, called their neighbors by unseemly nicknames, wronged the orphan and the widow, and bore false witness. Therefore bath God delivered them to these worms.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses went thence to another place, and there he saw sinners prone on their faces, with two thousand scorpions lashing, stinging, and tormenting them, while the tortured victims cried bitterly. Each of the scorpions had seventy thousand heads, each head seventy thousand mouths, each mouth seventy thousand stings, and each sting seventy thousand pouches of poison and venom, which the sinners are forced to drink down, although the anguish is so racking that their eyes melt in their sockets. Nasargiel explained: &quot;These are the sinners who caused the Israelites to lose their money, who exalted themselves above the community, who put their neighbors to shame in public, who delivered their fellow-Israelites into the hands of the Gentiles, who denied the Torah of Moses, and who maintained that God is not the Creator of the world.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Moses saw the place called Tit ba-Yawen, in which the sinners stand in mud up to their navels, while the Angels of Destruction lash them with fiery chains, and break their teeth with fiery stones, from morning until evening, and during the night they make their teeth grow again, to the length of a parasang, only to break them anew the next morning. Nasargiel explained: &quot;These are the sinners who ate carrion and forbidden flesh, who lent their money at usury, who wrote the Name of God on amulets for Gentiles, who used false weights, who stole money from their fellow-Israelites, who ate on the Day of Atonement, who ate forbidden fat, and animals and reptiles that are an abomination, and who drank blood.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Nasargiel said to Moses: &quot;Come and see how the sinners are burnt in hell,&quot; and Moses answered, &quot;I cannot go there,&quot; but Nasargiel replied, &quot;Let the light of the Shekinah precede thee, and the fire of hell will have no power over thee.&quot; Moses yielded, and he saw how the sinners were burnt, one half of their bodies being immersed in fire and the other half in snow, while worms bred in their own flesh crawled over them, and the Angels of Destruction beat them incessantly. Nasargiel </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">explained: &quot;These are the sinners who committed incest, murder, and idolatry, who cursed their parents and their teachers, and who, like Nimrod and others, called themselves gods.&quot; In this place, which is called Abaddon, he saw the sinners taking snow by stealth and putting it in their armpits, to relieve the pain inflicted by the scorching fire, and he was convinced that the saying was true, &quot;The wicked mend not their ways even at the gate of hell.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Mose departed from hell, he prayed to God, &quot;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to save me and the people of Israel from the places I have seen in hell.&quot; But God answered him, and said, &quot;Moses, before Me there is no respecting of persons and no taking of gifts. Whoever doeth good deeds entereth Paradise, and he that doeth evil must go to hell.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the command of God, Gabriel now led Moses to Paradise. As he entered, two angels came toward him, and they said to him, &quot;Thy time is not yet arrived to leave the world,&quot; and Moses made answer, &quot;What ye say is true, but I have come to see the reward of the pious in Paradise.&quot; Then the angels extolled Moses, saying: &quot;Hail, Moses, servant of God! Hail, Moses, born of woman, that hast been found worthy to ascend to the seven heavens! Hail to the nation to which thou belongest!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Under the tree of life Moses saw the angel Shamshiel, the prince of Paradise, who led him through it, and showed him all there is therein. He saw seventy thrones made of precious stones, standing on feet of fine gold, each throne surrounded by seventy angels. But one of them was larger than all the others, and it was encircled by one hundred and twenty angels. This was the throne of Abraham, and when Abraham beheld Moses, and heard who he was, and what his purpose was in visiting Paradise, he exclaimed, &quot;Praise ye the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth forever.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses asked Shamshiel about the size of Paradise, but not even he who is the prince thereof could answer the question, for there is none that can gauge it. It can neither be measured nor fathomed nor numbered. But Shamshiel explained to Moses about the thrones, that they were different one from the other, some being of silver, some of gold, some of precious stones and pearls and rubies and carbuncles. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">The thrones made of pearls are for the scholars that study the Torah day and night for her own sake; those of precious stones are for the pious, those of rubies for the just, those of gold for the repentant sinners, and those of silver for the righteous proselytes. &quot;The greatest of them all,&quot; continued Shamshiel, &quot;is the throne of Abraham, the next in size the thrones of Isaac and Jacob, then come the thrones of the prophets, the saints, and the righteous, each in accordance with a man&apos;s worth, and his rank, and the good deeds he has performed in his lifetime.&quot; Moses asked then for whom the throne of copper was intended, and the angel answered, &quot;For the sinner that has a pious son. Through the merits of his son he receives it as his share.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Again Moses looked, and he beheld a spring of living water welling up from under the tree of life and dividing into four streams, which passed under the throne of glory, and thence encompassed Paradise from end to end. He also saw four rivers flowing under each of the thrones of the pious, one of honey, the second of milk, the third of wine, and the fourth of pure balsam.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Beholding all these desirable and pleasant things, Moses felt great joy, and he said, &quot;Oh, how great is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which Thou hast wrought for them that put their trust in Thee, before the sons of men!&quot; And Moses left Paradise, and returned to the earth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At the moment of his departure, a heavenly voice cried aloud: &quot;Moses, servant of the Lord, thou that art faithful in His house, even as thou hast seen the reward that is laid up for the pious in the world to come, so also thou wilt be worthy of seeing the life of the world that shall be in the future time. Thou and all Israel, ye shall see the rebuilding of the Temple and the advent of the Messiah, behold the beauty of the Lord, and meditate in His Temple.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the world to come Moses, beside sharing the joys of Israel, will continue his activity as the teacher of Israel, for the people will go before Abraham and request him to instruct them in the Torah. He will send them to Isaac, saying, &quot;Go to Isaac, he hath studied more of the Torah than ever I studied,&quot; but Isaac, in turn, will send them to Jacob, saying, &quot;Go to Jacob, he hath had more converse with the sages than ever I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">had.&quot; And Jacob will send them to Moses, saying, &quot;Go to Moses, he was instructed in the Torah by God Himself.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the Messianic time, Moses will be one of the seven shepherds that shall be the leaders of Israel with the Messiah.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Moses Declines The Mission</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses turned aside to see the great sight, that the bush was not consumed, he heard a voice calling to him, &quot;Draw not nigh hither.&quot; These words were to convey that the dignity to be conferred upon him God intended for Moses personally, not for his descendants, and further he was warned not to arrogate honors appointed for others, as the priesthood, which was to belong to Aaron and Aaron&apos;s descendants, or royalty, which was to appertain to David and the house of David.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Again the voice spake: &quot;Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.&quot; These words conveyed the desire of God that he cut asunder every bond uniting him with earthly concerns, he was even to give up his conjugal life. Hereupon the angel Michael spoke to God: &quot;O Lord of the world, can it be Thy purpose to destroy mankind? Blessing can prevail only if male and female are united, and yet Thou biddest Moses separate from his wife.&quot; God answered, saying, &quot;Moses has begot children, he has done his duty toward the world. I desire him to unite himself now with the Shekinah, that she may descend upon earth for his sake.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God spake furthermore, addressing Moses, &quot;Thou seest only what is to happen in the near future, that Israel is to receive the Torah on Mount Sinai, but I behold what cometh after, bow the people will worship the steer, the figure of which they will see upon My chariot, even while My revelation will be made on Sinai. Thus they will excite My wrath. Nevertheless, though I know all the perverseness of their hearts, wherein they will rebel against Me in the desert, I will redeem them now, for I accord unto man the treatment he merits for his present actions, not what he will deserve in the future. I promised their father Jacob, &apos;I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again,&apos; and now I will betake myself thither, to bring Israel up in accordance with My words unto Jacob, and bear them to the land I swore unto their fathers, that their seed should inherit it. So long as the time of affliction that I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">had appointed unto his seed in My revelation to Abraham was not past, I hearkened not to the supplication and the groaning of his children, but now the end hath come. Therefore, go before Pharaoh, that he dismiss My people. If thou dost not bring about the redemption, none other will, for there is none other that can do it. In thee doth Israel hope, and upon thee doth Israel wait. The matter lieth in thine hands alone.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses, however, refused to take the mission upon himself. He said to God, &quot;Thy promise unto Jacob was, &apos;I will surely bring thee up again out of Egypt.&apos; Thou didst undertake to do it Thyself, and now it is Thy purpose to send me thither. And how, indeed, were it possible for me to accomplish this great matter, to bring the children of Israel up out of Egypt? How could I provide them with food and drink? Many are the women in childbirth among them, many are the pregnant women and the little children. Whence shall I procure dainties for those who have borne babes, whence sweetmeats for the pregnant, and whence tidbits for the little ones? And how may I venture to go among the Egyptian brigands and murderers? for Thou art bidding me to go to mine enemies, to those who lie in wait to take my life. Why should I risk the safety of my person, seeing that I know not whether Israel possesses merits making them worthy of redemption?&apos; I have reckoned up the years with care, and I have found that but two hundred and ten have elapsed since the covenant of the pieces made with Abraham, and at that time Thou didst ordain four hundred years of oppression for his seed.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But God overturned all his objections. He spake to Moses, saying: &quot;I will be with thee. Whatever thou desirest I will do, so that the redemption will in very truth be realized through Me, in accordance with My promise to Jacob. The little ones that Israel will carry up out of Egypt I will provide with food for thirty days. This shall prove to thee in what manner I will supply the needs of all. And as I will be at thy side, thou hast no need to fear any man. Respecting thy doubt, whether Israel deserves to be redeemed, this is My answer: they will be permitted to go forth from Egypt on account of the merits they will acquire at this mountain, whereon they will receive the Torah through thee. And thy reckoning of the end is not correct, for the four hundred years of bondage began with the birth of Isaac, not with the going down of Jacob into Egypt. Therefore the appointed end hath come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Persuaded now of God&apos;s unalterable resolve to use him as His instrument in the redemption of Israel from Egypt, Moses entreated God to impart to him the knowledge of His Great Name, that he be not confounded if the children of Israel ask for it. God answered, saying: &quot;Thou desirest to know My Name? My Name is according to My acts. When I judge My creatures, I am called Elohim, &quot;judge&quot;; when I rise up to do battle against the sinners, I am Lord Zebaot, &quot;the Lord of hosts&quot;; when I wait with longsuffering patience for the improvement of the sinner, My name is El Shaddai; when I have mercy upon the world, I am Adonai. But unto the children of Israel shalt thou say that I am He that was, that is, and that ever will be, and I am He that is with them in their bondage now, and He that shall be with them in the bondage of the time to come.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In reply to the latter words of God, Moses said, &quot;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,&quot; and God assented thereto. He admitted that it was not proper to force the knowledge of future suffering upon Israel in a present that was itself full of evil and sorrow. And the Lord said to Moses: &quot;My words about the future were meant for thee alone, not also for them. Tell the children of Israel, besides, that at My behest an angel can stretch his hand from heaven and touch the earth with it, and three angels can find room under one tree, and My majesty can fill the whole world, for when it was My will, it appeared to Job in his hair, and, again, when I willed otherwise, it appeared in a thorn-bush.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But the most important communication from God to Moses concerning the Divine Names were the words to follow: &quot;In mercy I created the world; in mercy I guide it; and with mercies I will return to Jerusalem. But unto the children of Israel thou shalt say that My mercy upon them is for the sake of the merits of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Moses heard these words, he spoke to God, saying, &quot;Are there men that transgress after death?&quot; and when God assured him that it was not possible for the dead to sin, Moses asked again, &quot;Why, then, is it that Thou didst reveal Thyself to me at the first as the God of my father, and now Thou passest him over?&quot; Whereupon God said, &quot;In the beginning it was My purpose to address thee with flattering words, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">but now thou hearest the whole and exact truth, I am only the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses prayed to God, entreating Him to reveal His Great and Holy Name unto him, so that he might call upon Him with it and secure the fulfilment of all his wishes. The Lord granted the prayer of Moses, and when the celestials knew that He had revealed the secret of the Ineffable Name, they cried out, &quot;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, gracious Giver of knowledge!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God is always regardful of the honor of the elders of a people, and He bade Moses assemble those of Israel and announce the approaching redemption to them. And as God knew beforehand how Pharaoh&apos;s obduracy would display itself, He made it known to Moses at once, lest he reproach God later with the Egyptian king&apos;s frowardness.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Moses Punished For His Stubbornness</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In spite of all these safeguards, Moses was not yet ready to accept the mission God wished to impose upon him. He persisted in urging his fears, saying: &quot;But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, &apos;The Lord hath not appeared unto thee. And the Lord said unto him, &quot;What is that in thine hand?&quot; And he said, &quot;A rod.&quot; And the Lord said: &quot;Thou deservest to be castigated with it. If thou didst not intend to take My mission upon thyself, thou shouldst have said so in the beginning. Instead, thou didst hold back with thy refusal, until I revealed to thee the great secret of the Ineffable Name, that thou mightest know it if the children of Israel should ask thee concerning it. And now thou sayest, I will not go. Now, therefore, if thou wilt not execute My charge to thee, it will be executed by this rod. It was My wish to distinguish thee and make thee My instrument for doing many miracles. But thou deservest a punishment for having suspected My children of lack of faith. The children of Israel are believers and sons of believers, but thou wilt show thyself of little faith in thy career, and as thou followest the example of the slanderous serpent, so shalt thou be punished with leprosy, wherewith the serpent was punished.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Lord now bade Moses put his hand into his bosom and take it out again, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. And God bade </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">him put his hand into his bosom again, and it turned again as his other flesh. Beside being a chastisement for his hasty words, the plague on his hand was to teach him that as the leper defiles, so the Egyptians defiled Israel, and as Moses was healed of his uncleanness, so God would cleanse the children of Israel of the pollution the Egyptians had brought upon them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The second wonder connected with the rod of Moses likewise conveyed a double meaning, in that it pointed to the coming redemption of Israel, and taught Moses a specific lesson. At the bidding of God, Moses cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, to show him that when he traduced Israel, he was following the example of the abusive serpent, and also to show him that the great dragon that lieth in the midst of the rivers of Egypt, though he was now hacking into Israel with his teeth, would be rendered harmless like the rod of wood, which has no power to bite.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">And, again, through the third miracle he was bidden to perform, God conveyed to Moses what would happen in the latter years of his own life. The sign He gave him was to make known to him that, before the water came, blood would flow from the rock at Meribah, when Moses should strike it after uttering the hasty, impatient words that were destined to bring death down upon him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">For seven days God urged Moses to undertake the mission He desired him to execute. He resorted to persuasion, that the heathen might not say, that He abused His power as the Ruler of the world, forcing men to do His service against their will. But Moses remained obdurate, he could not be won over. He said: &quot;Thou doest a wrong unto me in sending me to Pharaoh. In the palace of the Egyptian king there are persons that know how to speak the seventy languages of the world. No matter what language a man may use, there is someone that understands him. If I should come as Thy representative, and they should discover that I am not able to converse in the seventy languages, they will mock at me, and say, &apos;Behold this man, he pretends to be the ambassador of the Creator of the world, and he cannot speak the seventy languages.&apos;&quot; To this God made reply, as follows: &quot;Adam, who was taught by none, could give names to the beasts in the seventy languages. Was it not I that made him to speak?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Moses was not yet satisfied, he continued to urge objections, and he said: &quot;O Lord of the world, Thou wouldst charge me with the task of chastising Egypt and redeeming Israel, and I am ready to be Thy messenger. But is it seemly that a man should execute two errands at once? Nay, my Lord, for this two men are needed.&quot; God made answer, and said, &quot;Moses, I know well whom thou hast in mind with thy request, to be thy companion in the mission I assign to thee. Know, therefore, that the holy spirit hath already come upon thy brother Aaron, and even now he is awaiting thee on the way of Egypt, and when his eyes rest upon thee he will rejoice.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Furthermore God spake to Moses, saying, &quot;When I appeared unto thee the first time, thou wast meek, and didst hide thy face, not to see the vision. Whence cometh now this effrontery of thine, that thou addressest Me as a servant his master? Thou speakest too many words by far. Perchance thou thinkest I have no messengers, hosts, seraphim, ofanim, ministering angels, and Merkabah wheels, to send to Egypt, to bring My children thence, that thou sayest, &apos;Send by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.&apos; In sooth, thou deservest severe chastisement. But what can I do, seeing that I am the Master of mercy? If thou escapest unpunished, thou owest it to thy father Amram, who rendered great services in behalf of the preservation of the Israelitish people in Egypt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But Moses replied: &quot;O Lord of the world, I a prophet and the son of a prophet obeyed Thy words only after much hesitation, and I cannot expect Pharaoh, a wicked man and the son of a wicked man, and the Egyptians, a disobedient people and the sons of a disobedient people, to give ear to my words. O Lord of the world, Thou dost send me to Egypt to redeem sixty myriads of Thy people from the oppression of the Egyptians. If it were a question of delivering a couple of hundred men, it were a sufficiently difficult enterprise. How much severer is the task of freeing sixty myriads from the dominion of Pharaoh! If Thou hadst called upon the Egyptians to give up their evil ways soon after they began to enslave Israel, they might have heeded Thy admonitions. But if I should go and speak to them now, after they have been ruling over Israel these two hundred and ten years, Pharaoh would say, &apos;If a slave has served his master for ten years, and no protest has made itself heard from any quarter, how can a man conceive the idea suddenly of having him set at liberty?&apos; </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Verily, O Lord of the world, the task Thou puttest upon me is too heavy for my strength.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses said furthermore: &quot;I am not an eloquent man, nor can I see of what avail words can be in this matter. Thou art sending me to one that is himself a slave, to Pharaoh of the tribe of Ham, and a slave will not be corrected by words. I consent to go on Thy errand only if Thou wilt invest me with the power of chastising Pharaoh with brute force.&quot; To these words spoken by Moses, God made reply: &quot;Let it not fret thee that thou art not an eloquent speaker. It is I that made the mouth of all that speak, and I that made men dumb. One I make to see, another I make blind; one I make to hear, another I make deaf. Had I willed it so, thou hadst been a man of ready speech. But I desired to show a wonder through thee. Whenever I will it, the words I cast into thy mouth shall come forth without hesitation. But what thou sayest about a slave, that he cannot be corrected by words, is true, and therefore I give thee My rod for Pharaoh&apos;s castigation.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Moses still stood his ground. He raised other objections. &quot;His grandchild,&quot; he said, &quot;is closer to a man than his nephew. Nevertheless when Lot was taken captive, Thou didst send angels to the aid of Abraham&apos;s nephew. But now, when the life of sixty myriads of Abraham&apos;s lineal descendants is at stake, Thou sendest me, and not the angels. When the Egyptian bondwoman Hagar was in distress, Thou didst dispatch five angels to stand by her, and to redeem sixty myriads of the children of Sarah Thou dost dispatch me. O Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send in days to come.&quot; To this God answered, saying, &quot;I said not that I would send thee to Israel, but to Pharaoh, and that one whom thou madest mention of, I will send to Israel at the end of days--Elijah will appear to them before the great and terrible day.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">If Moses refused to do the errand of the Lord, there was a reason. God had revealed to him the treasures of the Torah, of wisdom, and of knowledge, and the whole world&apos;s future. Now he beheld in the inner chamber of God rows of scholars and judges interpreting the Torah in forty-nine different ways as they sat in the court of hewn stones; and he saw, besides, Rabbi Akiba explaining the meaning of the crowns upon the letters. Then said Moses: &quot;I do not care to be God&apos;s messenger. Let </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Him rather send one of these great scholars.&quot; Then God ordered the Angel of Wisdom to carry Moses to a place of myriads of scholars, all interpreting the Torah, and all making use of the formula: This is a Halakah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. Now Moses recognized that even the greatest scholars of future generations would be dependent upon him, and then, at last, he was ready to execute the mission God desired to lay upon him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Moses had to pay dear for having hesitated in the execution of the Divine bidding. God said to him: &quot;It was appointed that thou shouldst be priest, and Aaron should be the Levite. Because thou hast refused to execute My will, thou shalt be the Levite, and Aaron shall be priest,&quot;--a punishment that did not fall upon Moses personally, but only upon his descendants, all of whom are Levites. As for himself, he performed a priest&apos;s service in the Tabernacle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses had said to God, &quot;Thou hast been speaking to me now these many days, nevertheless I am still slow of speech and of a slow tongue.&quot; For this he received another punishment. God said to him: &quot;I might change thee into a new man, and heal thee of thy imperfect speech, but because thou hast uttered such words, I refrain from curing thee.&quot;</text:p>

Then God said, “Now put your hand back in your coat.” He put his hand back in his coat; and when he took it out, it was as healthy as the rest of his body. “If they won’t believe you or heed the evidence of the first sign, they will be convinced by the second. But if they aren’t persuaded even by both these signs and still won’t listen to what you say, then take some water from the river, and pour it on the ground.

   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Return To Egypt</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses finally gave in, and declared himself ready to go to Egypt as God&apos;s messenger, his acceptance was still conditional upon the promise of God to fulfil all his wishes, and God granted whatsoever he desired, except immortality and entering the Holy Land. God also allayed his fears regarding the danger that threatened him from his whilom enemies Dathan and Abiram, on account of whom he had had to flee from Egypt. He told him that they had sunk to the estate of poor and insignificant men, bereft of the power of doing him harm.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses was loyal to the oath he had given his father-in-law Jethro, never to return to Egypt without securing his consent. His first concern therefore was to go back to Midian and obtain his permission, which Jethro gave freely. Then Moses could set out on his journey. He tarried only to take his wife and his children with him, which made his father-in-law say, &quot;Those who are in Egypt are to leave it, and thou desirest to take more thither?&quot; Moses replied: &quot;Very soon the slaves held in bondage in Egypt will be redeemed, and they will go forth from the land, and gather at Mount Sinai, and hear the words, &apos;I am the Lord thy God,&apos; and should my sons not be present there?&quot; Jethro acknowledged the justice of Moses&apos; words, and he said to him, &quot;Go in peace, enter Egypt in peace, and leave the land in peace.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At last Moses sallied forth upon his journey to Egypt, accompanied by his wife and his children. He was mounted upon the very ass that had borne Abraham to the Akedah on Mount Moriah, the ass upon which the Messiah will appear riding at the end of days. Even now, his journey begun, Moses was but half-hearted about his mission. He travelled leisurely, thinking: &quot;When I arrive in Egypt and announce to the children of Israel that the end of the term of Egyptian slavery has come, they will say, &apos;We know very well that our bondage must last four hundred years, and the end is not yet,&apos; but if I were to put this objection before God, He would break out in wrath against me. It is best for me to consume as much time as possible on the way thither.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God was ill pleased with Moses for this artifice, and He spake to him, saying, &quot;Joseph prophesied long ago that the oppression of Egypt would endure only two hundred and ten years.&quot; For his lack of faith Moses was punished while he was on the road to Egypt. The angels Af and Hemah appeared and swallowed his whole body down to his feet, and they gave him up only after Zipporah, nimble as a &quot;bird,&quot; circumcised her son Gershom, and touched the feet of her husband with the blood of the circumcision. The reason why their son had remained uncircumcised until then was that Jethro had made the condition, when he consented to the marriage of his daughter with Moses, that the first son of their union should be brought up as a Gentile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>When Moses was released by the angels, he attacked them, and he slew Hemah, whose host of angels, however, held their own before the assailant.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Divine voice heard by Moses in Midian telling him to return to his brethren in Egypt fell at the same time upon the ear of Aaron, dwelling in Egypt, and it bade him &quot;go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&quot; God speaketh marvellously with His voice, and therefore the same revelation could be understood one way in Midian and another way in Egypt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The greeting of the two brothers was very cordial. Envy and jealousy had no place between them. Aaron was rejoiced that God had chosen his younger brother to be the redeemer of Israel, and Moses was rejoiced that his older brother had been divinely appointed the high priest in Israel. God knew their hearts, for at the time when He charged him with the Egyptian mission, Moses had said, &quot;All these years Aaron has been active as a prophet in Israel, and should I now encroach upon his province and cause him vexation?&quot; But God reassured him, saying, &quot;Moses, thy brother Aaron will surely not be vexed, he will rather rejoice at thy mission, yea, he will come forth and meet thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Aaron showed his joy freely at seeing his brother once more, after their separation of many years. As for his joy in the distinction accorded to Moses, it was too great to be expressed in all its depth and extent. For his kind, generous spirit, he received a reward from God, in that he was permitted to bear the Urim and Thummim upon his heart, &quot;for,&quot; God said, &quot;the heart that rejoiced at the exalting of a brother shall wear the Urim and Thummim.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Aaron ran to meet his brother, and embraced him, and asked where he had spent all the years of their separation. When he was told in Midian, he continued to question him, saying, &quot;Who are these that are travelling with thee?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses: &quot;My wife and my sons.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Aaron: &quot;Whither goest thou with them?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses: &quot;To Egypt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Aaron &quot;What! Great enough is our sorrow through those who have been in Egypt from the beginning, and thou takest more to the land?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses recognized that Aaron was right, and he sent his wife and his sons back to his father-in-law Jethro.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He was no less magnanimous than Aaron. If the elder brother felt no envy on account of the younger brother&apos;s dignity, the younger brother did not withhold from the other the teachings and revelations he had received. Immediately after meeting with Aaron, Moses told him all that God had taught him, even the awful secret of the Ineffable Name communicated to him on Mount Horeb.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In obedience to the command of God, the elders of the people were assembled, and before them Moses performed the wonders that were to be his credentials as the redeemer sent to deliver the people. Nevertheless, the deeds he did were not so potent in convincing them of the reality of the mission as the words wherein God had announced the approaching redemption to him, which he repeated in their ears. The elders knew that Jacob had imparted to Joseph the secret mark designating the redeemer, and Joseph had in turn confided it to his brethren before his death. The last surviving one of the brethren, Asher, had revealed it to his daughter Serah, in the following words: &quot;He that will come and proclaim the redemption with the words of God, &apos;I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt,&apos; he is the true redeemer.&quot; Serah was still alive at Moses&apos; return, and the elders betook themselves to her, and told her the words of Moses announcing the redemption. When she heard that his words had been the same as those Asher had quoted, she knew that he was the promised redeemer, and all the people believed in him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thereupon Moses invited the elders to go to Pharaoh with him, but they lacked the courage to appear before the king. Though they started out with Moses, they dropped off stealthily on the way, one by one, and when Moses and Aaron stood in the presence of the king, they found themselves alone, deserted by all the others. The elders did not go out free. Their punishment was that God did not permit them to ascend the holy mountain with Moses. They durst accompany him on the way to God only as far as they had accompanied him on the way to Pharaoh, and then they had to tarry until he came again.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4"><text:soft-page-break/>Haggada - Moses And Aaron Before Pharaoh</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The day Moses and Aaron made their appearance before Pharaoh happened to be the anniversary of his birth, and he was surrounded by many kings, for he was the ruler of the whole world, and this was the occasion on which the kings of the earth came to do him homage. When the attendants announced Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh inquired whether the two old men had brought him crowns, and, receiving a negative reply, he ordered that they were not to be admitted to his presence, until he had seen and dismissed all the others desirous of paying him their respects.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh&apos;s palace was surrounded by a vast army. It was built with four hundred entrances, one hundred on each side, and each of them guarded by sixty thousand soldiers. Moses and Aaron were overawed by this display of power, and they were afraid. But the angel Gabriel appeared, and he led them into the palace, observed by none of the guards, and Pharaoh decreed severe punishment upon the inattentive sentinels for having admitted the old men without his permission. They were dismissed, and others put in their places. But the same thing happened the next day. Moses and Aaron were within the palace, and the new guard had not been able to hinder their passing. Pharaoh questioned his servants, how it had been possible for the two old men to enter, and they said: &quot;We know it not! Through the doors they did not come. Surely, they must be magicians.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Not enough that the palace was guarded by a host, at each entrance two lions were stationed, and in terror of being torn to pieces none dared approach the doors, and none could go within until the lion tamer came and led the beasts away. Now Balaam and all the other sacred scribes of Egypt advised that the keepers loose the lions at the approach of Moses and Aaron. But their advice availed naught. Moses had but to raise his rod, and the lions bounded toward him joyously, and followed at his feet, gambolling like dogs before their master on his return home</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Within the palace, Moses and Aaron found seventy secretaries busy with Pharaoh&apos;s correspondence, which was carried on in seventy languages. At the sight of the messengers of Israel, they started up in great awe, for the two men resembled angels. In stature they were as the cedars of Lebanon, their countenances radiated splendor like the sun, the pupils of their eyes were like the sphere of the morning </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">star, their beards like palm branches, and their mouths emitted flames when they opened them for speech. In their terror, the secretaries flung down pen and paper, and prostrated themselves before Moses and Aaron.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now the two representatives of the children of Israel stepped before Pharaoh, and they spake, &quot;The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray thee, three days&apos; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&quot; But Pharaoh answered, saying: &quot;What is the name of your God? Wherein doth His strength consist, and His power? How many countries, how many provinces, how many cities hath He under His dominion? In how many campaigns was He victorious? How many lands did He make subject to Himself? How many cities did He capture? When He goeth to war, how many warriors, riders, chariots, and charioteers doth He lead forth?&quot; Whereto Moses and Aaron replied: &quot;His strength and His power fill the whole world. His voice heweth out flames of fire; His words break mountains in pieces. The heaven is His throne, and the earth His footstool. His bow is fire, His arrows are flames, His spears torches, His shield clouds, and His sword lightning flashes. He created the mountains and the valleys, He brought forth spirits and souls, He stretched out the earth by a word, He made the mountains with His wisdom, He forms the embryo in the womb of the mother, He covers the heavens with clouds, at His word the dew and the rain descend earthward, He causes plants to grow from the ground, He nourishes and sustains the whole world, from the horns upon the rem down to the eggs of vermin. Every day He causes men to die, and every day He calls men into life.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh answered, and said: &quot;I have no need of Him. I have created myself, and if ye say that He causes dew and rain to descend, I have the Nile, the river that hath its source under the tree of life, and the ground impregnated by its waters bears fruit so huge that it takes two asses to carry it. and it is palatable beyond description, for it has three hundred different tastes.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then Pharaoh sent to fetch the books of the chronicles of his kingdom from his archives, wherein are recorded the names of the gods of all the nations, to see whether the name of the God of the Hebrews was among them. He read off: &quot;The gods of Moab, the gods of Ammon, the gods of Zidon--I do not find your God </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">inscribed in the archives!&quot; Moses and Aaron exclaimed: &quot;O thou fool! Thou seekest the Living in the graves of the dead. These which thou didst read are the names of dumb idols, but our God is the God of life and the King of eternal life.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Pharaoh said the words, &quot;I know not the Lord,&quot; God Himself made answer, saying: &quot;O thou rascal! Thou sayest to My ambassadors, &apos;I know not the strength and the power of your God&apos;? Lo, I will make thee to stand, for to show thee My power, and that My Name may be declared throughout all the earth.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Having searched his list of the gods of the nations in vain for a mention of the God of the Hebrews, Pharaoh cited before him the wise men of Egypt, and he said to them: &quot;Have ye ever heard the name of the God of these people?&quot; They replied, &quot;We have been told that He is a son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.&quot; Then spake God, saying, &quot;O ye fools! Ye call yourselves wise men, but Me ye call only the son of the wise. Verily, I will set at naught all your wisdom and your understanding.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh persisted in his obduracy, even after Moses and Aaron had performed the miracle of the rod. At the time when the two Hebrews succeeded in entering the palace, guarded as it was by lions, Pharaoh had sent for his magicians, at their head Balaam and his two sons Jannes and Jambres, and when they appeared before him, he told them of the extraordinary incident, how the lions had followed the two old men like dogs, and fawned upon them. It was Balaam&apos;s opinion that they were simply magicians like himself and his companions, and he prayed the king to have them come before him together with themselves, to test who were the master magicians, the Egyptians or the Hebrews.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and he said to them: &quot;Who will believe you when you say that you are the ambassadors of God, as you pretend to be, if you do not convince men by performing wonders?&quot; Thereupon Aaron cast his rod to the ground, and it became a serpent. Pharaoh laughed aloud. &quot;What,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;is this all your God can do? It is the way of merchants to carry merchandise to a place if there is none of it there, but would anyone take brine to Spain or fish to Accho? It seems you do not know that I am an adept in all sorts of magic!&quot; He ordered little school children to be brought, and they repeated the wonder done by Moses and Aaron; indeed, Pharaoh&apos;s own wife performed it. Jannes and Jambres, the sons of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Balaam, derided Moses, saying, &quot;Ye carry straw to Ephrain!&quot; whereto Moses answered, &quot;To the place of many vegetables, thither carry vegetables.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">To show the Egyptians that Aaron could do something with his rod that their magicians could not imitate, God caused the serpent into which His rod had been changed to swallow up all the rods of the magicians. But Balaam and his associates said: &quot;There is nothing marvellous or astonishing in this feat. Your serpent has but devoured our serpents, which is in accordance with a law of nature, one living being devours another. If thou wishest us to acknowledge that the spirit of God worketh in thee, then cast thy rod to the earth, and if, being wood, it swallows up our rods of wood, then we shall acknowledge that the spirit of God is in thee.&quot; Aaron stood the test. After his rod had resumed its original form, it swallowed up the rods of the Egyptians, and yet its bulk showed no increase. This caused Pharaoh to reflect, whether this wonderful rod of Aaron might not swallow up also him and his throne. Nevertheless he refused to obey the behest of God, to let Israel go, saying, &quot;Had I Jacob-Israel himself here before me, I should put trowel and bucket on his shoulder.&quot; And to Moses and Aaron, he said, &quot;Because ye, like all the rest of the tribe of Levi, are not compelled to labor, therefore do ye speak, &apos;Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.&apos; If you had asked for a thousand people, or two thousand, I should have fulfilled your request, but never will I consent to let six hundred thousand men go away.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After that, Moshe and Aharon came and said to Pharaoh, “Here is what </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, the God of Isra’el, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they can celebrate a festival in the desert to honor me.’” But Pharaoh replied, “Who is </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, that I should obey when he says to let Isra’el go? I don’t know </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, and I also won’t let Isra’el go.” They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us.

Otherwise, he may strike us with a plague or with the sword.” The king of Egypt answered them, “Moshe and Aharon, what do you mean by taking the people away from their work? Get back to your labor! Look!” Pharaoh added, “the population of the land has grown, yet you are trying to have them stop working!”</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Beside refusing to dismiss the children of Israel, he ordered, on the very day of Moses and Aaron&apos;s audience with him, that the people be required to deliver the prescribed tale of bricks, though the taskmasters were not as heretofore to give them straw to make brick. Another decree was, that the children of Israel were not to be permitted to rest on the Sabbath, for Pharaoh knew that they used the leisure for reading the rolls that described their redemption. All this was a part of God&apos;s plan, the oppression of Israel was to be increased the closer the end approached. As they wandered up and down the land of Egypt gathering the straw they needed for the due tale of bricks, they were maltreated by the Egyptians if they caught them on their fields. Such unkind acts perpetrated by the whole people made it impossible for them to cast the entire blame for the bondage of Israel upon Pharaoh. All the Egyptians showed cruelty to the Israelites on their straw foraging expeditions, and therefore the Divine punishment descended upon all alike.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">This frightful time of Israel&apos;s extreme suffering lasted six months. Meantime Moses went to Midian, leaving Aaron alone in Egypt. When Moses returned at the end of the reign of terror, two of the Israelitish officers accosted him and Aaron, and heaped abuse upon them for having increased the woes of their people rather than diminished them. They spake, saying, &quot;If ye are truly the ambassadors of God, then may He judge between us and Pharaoh. But if you are seeking to bring about the redemption of Israel on your own account, then may God judge between you and Israel. You are responsible for the widespread stench now issuing from the Israelitish corpses used as bricks for building when our tale was not complete. The Egyptians had but a faint suspicion that we were waiting for our redemption. It is your fault if they are fully conscious of it now. We are in the quandary of the poor sheep that has been dragged away by a wolf. The shepherd pursues the robber, catches up with him, and tries to snatch the sheep from his jaws, and the wretched victim, pulled this way by the wolf and that way by the shepherd, is torn to pieces. Thus Israel fares between you and Pharaoh.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The two officers that spake these stinging words were Dathan and Abiram, and it was neither the first nor the last time they inflicted an injury upon Moses. The other Israelitish officers were gentle and kind; they permitted themselves to be beaten by the taskmasters rather than prod the laborers of their own people put under their surveillance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The cruel suffering to which his people was exposed caused Moses to speak to God thus: &quot;I have read the book of Genesis through, and I found the doom in it pronounced upon the <text:soft-page-break/>generation of the deluge. It was a just judgment. I found also the punishments decreed against the generation of the confusion of tongues, and against the inhabitants of Sodom. These, too, were just. But what hath this nation of Israel done unto Thee, that it is oppressed more than any other nation in history? Is it because Abraham said, &apos;Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the land?&apos; and Thou didst rebuke him for his small faith, saying, &apos;Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs&apos;? Why, then, are not the descendants of Esau and Ishmael held in bondage, too? Are they not likewise of the seed of Abraham? But if Thou wilt say, &apos;What concern is it of mine?&apos; then I ask Thee, Why didst Thou send me hither as Thy messenger? Thy great, exalted, and terrible Name is feared in all the earth, yet Pharaoh heard me pronounce it, and he refuses obedience. I know Thou wilt redeem Israel in Thine own good time, and it is of little moment to Thee that now they are immuring living Israelites in these buildings.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Were He a God of justice only, the Lord would have slain Moses for the audacity of his last words, but in view of his having spoken as he had only out of compassion with Israel, the Lord dealt graciously with him. He answered Moses, saying, &quot;Thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh,&quot; words conveying to Moses, that although he would be witness to the chastisement of Pharaoh, he would not be present at that of the thirty-one kings of Canaan. Thus he was rebuked for the unbecoming language he had used in addressing God. At the same time God&apos;s words were a rejoinder to another speech by Moses. He had said: &quot;O Lord of the world, I know well that Thou wilt bring Thy children forth from Egypt. O that Thou wouldst make use of another instrument, for I am not worthy of being the redeemer of Thy children.&quot; God made answer thereto: &quot;Yes, Moses, thou art worthy thereof. Through thee My children will be brought forth out of Egypt. Thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">At the same time God called him to account for having so little faith. He said: &quot;O for the departed, their like cannot be found any more! I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as El Shaddai, God Almighty, but I was not known to them by My name Adonai, God All-Merciful, as I appeared unto thee. Nevertheless they did not cast aspersions upon My acts. I spake to Abraham, &apos;Unto thee will I give the land,&apos; but when he was about to bury Sarah, he had to pay out silver and buy a resting-place for her body; and yet he did not find fault with Me. I spake to Isaac, &apos;Unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands,&apos; but when he desired water to drink, he had to strive with the herdsmen of Gerar; and yet he did not find fault with Me. I spake to Jacob, &apos;The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed,&apos; but when he wanted to spread his tent, he had to acquire a parcel of ground for an hundred pieces of money; and yet he did not find fault with Me. None of them asked to know My Name. But thou didst demand to know it at the very first, when I desired to send thee <text:soft-page-break/>down into Egypt, and after I revealed it to thee, thou didst speak, saying, &apos;Thou didst tell me that Thou art called Compassionate and Gracious, Longsuffering and Merciful, but as soon as I pronounced this Name before Pharaoh, misfortune descended upon the people of Israel.&apos; Now I desire to fulfil My covenant with the three Patriarchs, and give their posterity the promised land, as a reward for the unquestioning faith of the Fathers, and also as a reward to the people, who, in spite of their suffering, did not find fault with My deeds. For this will I give them the land, which they do not deserve to possess for other reasons. I swear that I will do thus!&quot; God pronounced this oath, to banish all fear from the mind of Moses, that He might act only in accordance with His attribute of justice, and thus delay the redemption of Israel for a time, on account of the sins of the people.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Now the redemption of Israel was a settled fact. But before Moses and Aaron could start on the work of delivering their people, God called various points to their attention, which He bade them consider in their undertaking. He spake to them, saying: &quot;My children are perverse, passionate, and troublesome. You must be prepared to stand their abuse, to the length of being pelted with stones by them. I send you to Pharaoh, and although I will punish him according to his deserts, yet you must not fail in the respect due to him as a ruler. Furthermore, be careful to take the elders of the people into your counsel, and let your first step toward redemption be to make the people give up the worship of idols.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The last was a most difficult task, and the words of God concerning it wrung the exclamation from Moses: &quot;See, the children of Israel will not hearken unto me. How, then, should Pharaoh hearken unto me?&quot; It was the third time Moses declined to go on the errand of God. Now the Divine patience was exhausted, and Moses was subjected to punishment. At first God had revealed Himself only to Moses, and the original intention had been that he alone was to perform all the miracles, but henceforth the word of God was addressed to Aaron as well, and he was given a share in doing the wonders.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4"><text:span text:style-name="T27">Exodus</text:span> Continued...</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">That same day Pharaoh ordered the slavemasters and the people’s foremen, “You are no longer to provide straw for the bricks the people are making, as you did before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. But you will require them to produce the same quantity of bricks as before, don’t reduce it, because they’re lazing around. This is why they’re crying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ Give these people harder work to do. That will keep them too busy to pay attention to speeches full of lies.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>The people’s slavemasters went out, their foremen too, and said to the people, “Here is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will no longer give you straw. You go, yourselves, and get straw wherever you can find it. But your output is not to be reduced.’” So the people were dispersed throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. The slavemasters kept pressing them. “Keep working! Make your daily quota, just as when straw was provided.” The foremen of the people of Isra’el, whom Pharaoh’s slavemasters had appointed to be over them, were flogged and asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday and today, as you did formerly?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then the foremen of the people of Isra’el came and complained to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? No straw is given to your servants, yet they keep telling us to make bricks. And now your servants are being flogged, but the fault lies with your own people.” “Lazy!” he retorted, “You’re just lazy! That’s why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">.’ Get going now, and get back to work! No straw will be given to you, and you will still deliver the full amount of bricks.” When they said, “You are not to reduce your daily production quota of bricks,” the foremen of the people of Isra’el could see that they were in deep trouble.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As they were leaving Pharaoh, they encountered Moshe and Aharon standing by the road; and they said to them, “May </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> look at you and judge accordingly, because you have made us utterly abhorrent in the view of Pharaoh and his servants, and you have put a sword in their hands to kill us!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(Maftir)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Moshe returned to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and said, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, why have you treated this people so terribly? What has been the value of sending me? For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt terribly with this people! And you haven’t rescued your people at all!”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Measure For Measure</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God divided the ten punishments decreed for Egypt into four parts, three of the plagues He committed to Aaron, three to Moses, one to the two brothers together, and three He reserved for Himself. Aaron was charged with those, that proceeded from the earth and the water, the elements that are composed of more or less solid parts, from which are fashioned all the corporeal, distinctive entities, while the three entrusted to Moses were those that proceeded from the air and the fire, the elements that are most prolific of life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Lord is a man of war, and as a king of flesh and blood devises various stratagems against his enemy, so God attacked the Egyptians in various ways. He brought ten plagues down upon them. When a province rises up in rebellion, its sovereign lord first sends his army against it, to surround it and cut off the water supply. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he brings noise makers into the field against them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he orders darts to be discharged against them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he orders his legions to assault them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he causes bloodshed and carnage among them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he directs a stream of hot naphtha upon them. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he hurls projectiles at them from his ballistae. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he has scaling-ladders set up against their walls. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he casts them into dungeons. If the people are contrite, well and good; if not, he slays their magnates.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Thus did God proceed against the Egyptians. First He cut off their water supply by turning their rivers into blood. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He sent the noisy, croaking frogs into their entrails. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He brought lice against them, which pierced their flesh like darts. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He sent barbarian legions against them, mixed hordes of wild beasts. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He brought slaughter upon them, a very grievous pestilence. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He poured out naphtha over them, burning blains. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He caused His projectiles, the hail, to descend upon them. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He placed scaling-ladders against the wall for the locusts, which climbed them like men of war. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He cast them into dungeon darkness. They refused to let the Israelites go, and He slew their magnates, their first-born sons.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The plagues that God sent upon the Egyptians corresponded to the deeds they had perpetrated against the children of Israel. Because they forced the Israelites to draw </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">water for them, and also hindered them from the use of the ritual baths, He changed their water into blood.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Because they had said to the Israelites, &quot;Go and catch fish for us,&quot; He brought frogs up against them, making them to swarm in their kneading-troughs and their bed-chambers and hop around croaking in their entrails. It was the severest of all the ten plagues.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Because they had said to the Israelites, &quot;Go and sweep and clean our houses, our courtyards, and our streets,&quot; He changed the dust of the air into lice, so that the vermin lay piled up in heaps an ell high, and when the Egyptians put on fresh garments, they were at once infested with the insects.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The fourth plague was an invasion of the land by hordes of all sorts of wild animals, lions, wolves, panthers, bears, and others. They overran the houses of the Egyptians, and when they closed their doors to keep them out, God caused a little animal to come forth from the ground, and it got in through the windows, and split open the doors, and made a way for the bears, panthers, lions, and wolves, which swarmed in and devoured the people down to the infants in their cradles. If an Egyptian entrusted his ten children to an Israelite, to take a walk with them, a lion would come and snatch away one of the children, a bear would carry off the second, a serpent the third, and so on, and in the end the Israelite returned home alone. This plague was brought upon them because they were in the habit of bidding the Israelites go and catch wolves and lions for their circuses, and they sent them on such errands, to make them take up their abode in distant deserts, where they would be separated from their wives, and could not propagate their race.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then God brought a grievous murrain upon their cattle, because they had pressed the Israelites into their service as shepherds, and assigned remote pasturing places to them, to keep them away from their wives. Therefore the murrain came and carried off all the cattle in the flocks the Israelites were tending.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The sixth plague was a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. This was the punishment of the Egyptians, because they would say to the children of Israel, &quot;Go and prepare a bath for us unto the delight of our flesh and our bones.&quot; </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Therefore they were doomed to suffer with boils that inflamed their flesh, and on account of the itch they could not leave off scratching. While the Egyptians suffered thus, the children of Israel used their baths.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Because they had sent the Israelites forth into the fields, to plough and sow, hail was sent down upon them, and their trees and crops were destroyed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They had been in the habit of saying to the Israelites, &quot;Go forth, plant ye trees for us, and guard the fruit thereon.&quot; Therefore God brought the locusts into the Egyptian border, to eat the residue of that which was escaped, which remained unto them from the hail, for the teeth of the locust are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw teeth of a great lion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Because they would throw the Israelites into dungeons, God brought darkness upon them, the darkness of hell, so that they had to grope their way. He that sat could not rise up on his feet, and he that stood could not sit down. The infliction of darkness served another purpose. Among the Israelites there were many wicked men, who refused to leave Egypt, and God determined to put them out of the way. But that the Egyptians might not say they had succumbed to the plague like themselves, God slew them under cover of the darkness, and in the darkness they were buried by their fellow-Israelites, and the Egyptians knew nothing of what had happened. But the number of these wicked men had been very great, and the children of Israel spared to leave Egypt were but a small fraction of the original Israelitish population.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The tenth plague was the slaying of the first-born, and it came upon the Egyptians because of their intention to murder the men children of the Israelites at their birth, and, finally, Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the Red Sea, because the Egyptians had caused the men children of the Israelites to be exposed in the water.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Each of the plagues inflicted upon Egypt had another parallel in the cruel treatment accorded to the Israelites. The first was a punishment for the arrogant words spoken by Pharaoh, &quot;My Nile river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">T</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">h</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">e plague of the frogs God brought down upon the Egyptians, &quot;because,&quot; He said, &quot;the frogs, which sometimes inhabit the water, shall take vengeance upon the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation destined to be the bearers of the Torah, and the Torah is likened unto water.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God sent vermin upon them, saying, &quot;Let the lice made of the dust of the earth take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation whose seed is like unto the dust of the earth.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Hordes of beasts, lions and wolves and swarms of serpents, came down upon them, &quot;because,&quot; God said, &quot;these animals shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is likened unto lions, wolves, and serpents.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">A fatal pestilence was brought upon them, &quot;because,&quot; God said, &quot;death shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that faces death for the glorification of the Name of God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">They were made to suffer with burning blains, &quot;because,&quot; God said, &quot;the boils coming from the ashes of the furnace shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation whose ancestor Abraham walked into the fiery furnace for the glorification of the Name of God.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He made hail to descend upon them, &quot;because,&quot; He said, &quot;the white hail shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy a nation whose sins shall be white.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The locusts came upon them, &quot;because,&quot; God said, &quot;the locusts, which are My great army, shall take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is called My hosts.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">&quot;Darkness,&quot; said God, &quot;which is divided from the light, shall come and take vengeance upon the Egyptians for desiring to destroy the nation upon which shineth the light of the Lord, while gross darkness covers the other peoples.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The tenth plague, the slaying of the first-born, God inflicted, saying, &quot;I will take vengeance upon the Egyptians for having desired to destroy the nation that is My first-born. As the night divided itself for Abraham, that his enemies might be vanquished, so I will pass through Egypt in the middle of the night, and as Abraham </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">was proved by ten temptations, so I will send ten plagues upon Egypt, the enemy of his children.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Plagues Brought Through Aaron</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">From the infliction of the first of the plagues until the passing of the last, after which the Egyptians yielded all that Moses and Aaron demanded, there elapsed a whole year, for twelve months is the term set by God for the expiation of sins. The deluge lasted one year; Job suffered one year; sinners must endure hell tortures for one year, and the judgment upon Gog at the end of time will be executed for the length of one year.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses announced the first plague to Pharaoh one morning when the king was walking by the river&apos;s brink. This morning walk enabled him to practice a deception. He called himself a god, and pretended that he felt no human needs. To keep up the illusion, he would repair to the edge of the river every morning, and ease nature there while alone and unobserved. At such a time it was that Moses appeared before him, and called out to him, &quot;Is there a god that hath human needs?&quot; &quot;Verily, I am no god,&quot; replied Pharaoh, &quot;I only pretend to be one before the Egyptians, who are such idiots, one should consider them asses rather than human beings.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then Moses made known to him that God would turn the water into blood, if he refused to let Israel go. In the warning we can discern the difference between God and man. When a mortal harbors the intention to do an injury to an enemy, he lies in wait for the moment when he can strike an unexpected blow. But God is outspoken. He warned Pharaoh and the Egyptians in public whenever a plague was about to descend, and each warning was repeated by Moses for a period of three weeks, although the plague itself endured but a single week.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Pharaoh would not lay the warning to heart, the plague announced by Moses was let loose upon him and his people--the waters were turned into blood. It is a well-known proverb, &quot;Beat the idols, and the priests are in terror.&quot; God smote the river Nile, which the Egyptians worshipped as their god, in order to terrify Pharaoh and his people and force them to do the Divine will.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>To produce the plague, Aaron took his rod, and stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt. Moses had no part in performing the miracle, for God had said to him, &quot;The water that watched over thy safety when thou wast exposed in the Nile, shall not suffer harm through thee.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Aar</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">o</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">n had scarcely executed the Divine bidding, when all the water of Egypt became blood, even such as was kept in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. The very spittle of an Egyptian turned into blood no sooner had he ejected it from his mouth, and blood dripped also from the idols of the Egyptians.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The transformation of the waters into blood was intended mainly as a punishment for the oppressors, but it was at the same time a source of profit for the oppressed. It gave the Israelites the opportunity of amassing great wealth. The Egyptians paid them large sums for their water, for if an Egyptian and an Israelite drew water from the same trough, the portion carried off by the Egyptian was bound to be useless, it turned into blood. To be sure, nothing helped the Egyptians in their distress, for though they drank water from the same cup as an Israelite, it became blood in their mouth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">However, this plague did not impress Pharaoh as a punishment inflicted in the name of God, because with the help of the Angels of Destruction the magicians of Egypt produced the same phenomenon of changing water into blood. Therefore he hearkened not unto the words of Moses.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The next was the plague of the frogs, and again it was Aaron that performed the wonder. He stretched forth his hand with his rod over the rivers, and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. Moses, whose life had been preserved by the water, was kept from poisoning his savior with the reptiles. At first only a single frog appeared, but he began to croak, summoning so many companions that the whole land of Egypt swarmed with them. Wherever an Egyptian took up his stand, frogs appeared, and in some mysterious way they were able to pierce the hardest of metals, and even the marble palaces of the Egyptian nobles afforded no protection against them. If a frog came close to them, the walls split asunder immediately. &quot;Make way,&quot; the frogs would call out to the stone, &quot;that I may do the will of my Creator,&quot; and at once the marble showed a rift, through which the frogs entered, and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">then they attacked the Egyptians bodily, and mutilated and overwhelmed them. In their ardor to fulfil the behest of God, the frogs cast themselves into the red-hot flames of the bake-ovens and devoured the bread. Centuries later, the three holy children, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were ordered by Nebuchadnezzar to pay worship to his idols on penalty of death in the burning furnace, and they said, &quot;If the frogs, which were under no obligation to glorify the Name of God, nevertheless threw themselves into the fire in order to execute the Divine will concerning the punishment of the Egyptians, how much more should we be ready to expose our lives to the fire for the greater glory of His Name!&quot; And the zealous frogs were not permitted to go unrewarded. While the others were destroyed from Pharaoh and the Egyptian houses at the moment appointed as the last of the plague, God saved those in the bake-ovens alive, the fire had no power to do them the least harm.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Now, although the Egyptian magicians also brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt through the help of demons, Pharaoh nevertheless declared himself ready to let the people go, to sacrifice unto the Lord. The difference between this plague and the first was, that water turned into blood had not caused him any personal inconvenience, while the swarms of frogs inflicted physical suffering, and he gave the promise to Moses to let Israel go, in the hope of ridding himself of the pain he experienced. And Moses in turn promised to entreat God for him on the following day. It could not be done at once, because the seven days&apos; term had not yet elapsed. The prayer offered by Moses in behalf of Pharaoh was granted, all the frogs perished, and their destruction was too swift for them to retire to the water. Consequently the whole land was filled with the stench from the decaying frogs, for they had been so numerous that every man of the Egyptians gathered together four heaps of them. Although the frogs had filled all the market-places and stables and dwellings, they retreated before the Hebrews as if they had been able to distinguish between the two nations, and had known which of them it was proper to abuse, and which to treat with consideration. Beside sparing the Hebrews in the land of Egypt, the frogs kept within the limits of the land, in no wise trenching upon the territory of the neighboring nations. Indeed, they were the means of settling peaceably an old boundary dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia. Wherever they appeared, so far extended the Egyptian domain; all beyond their line belonged to Ethiopia.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>Pharaoh was like the wicked that cry to God in their distress, and when their fortunes prosper slide back into their old, impious ways. No sooner had the frogs departed from him, his houses, his servants, and his people, than he hardened his heart again, and refused to let Israel go. Thereupon God sent the plague of the lice, the last of those brought upon Egypt through the mediation of Aaron. Moses could have no part in it, &quot;for,&quot; said God, &quot;the earth that afforded thee protection when she permitted thee to hide the slain Egyptian, shall not suffer through thine hand.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Egyptian magicians having boasted that they were able to produce the first two plagues,--an empty boast it was, for they did not bring them about with their enchantments, but only because Moses willed them to do it,--God put them to shame with the third plague. They tried in vain to imitate it. The demons could not aid them, for their power is limited to the production of things larger than a barley grain, and lice are smaller. The magicians had to admit, &quot;This is the finger of God.&quot; Their failure put an end once for all to their attempts to do as Moses did.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But Pharaoh&apos;s heart was hardened, and God spake to Moses, saying, &quot;This wicked fellow remains hard of heart, in spite of the three plagues. The fourth shall be much worse than those which have preceded it. Go to him, therefore, and warn him, it would be well for him to let My people go, that the plague come not upon him.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Plagues Brought Through Moses</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The fourth plague was also announced to the king early in the morning by the river&apos;s brink. Pharaoh went thither regularly, for he was one of the magi, who need water for their enchantments. Moses&apos; daily morning visits were beginning to annoy him, and he left the house early, in the hope of circumventing his monitor. But God, who knows the thoughts of man, sent Moses to Pharaoh at the very moment of his going forth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The warning of the plague that was imminent not having had any effect upon Pharaoh, God sent the fourth plague upon Egypt, a mixed horde of wild animals, lions, bears, wolves, and panthers, and so many birds of prey of different kinds that the light of the sun and the moon was darkened as they circled through the air. These beasts came upon the Egyptians as a punishment for desiring to force the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">seed of Abraham to amalgamate with the other nations. God retaliated by bringing a mixture upon them that cost them their life.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Pharaoh had been the first of the Egyptians to lay evil plans against the children of Israel, so he was the first upon whom descended punishment. Into his house the mixed horde of beasts came first of all, and then into the houses of the rest of the Egyptians. Goshen, the land inhabited by the Israelites, was spared entirely, for God put a division between the two peoples. It is true, the Israelites had committed sins enough to deserve punishment, but the Holy One, blessed be He, permitted the Egyptians to act as a ransom for Israel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Again Pharaoh expressed his willingness to let the children of Israel sacrifice unto their God, but they were to stay in the land and do it, not go outside, into the wilderness. Moses pointed out to Pharaoh how unbecoming it would be for the Israelites to sacrifice, before the very eyes of his people, the animals that the Egyptians worshipped as gods. Then Pharaoh consented to let them go beyond the borders of his land, only they were not to go very far away, and Moses, to mislead him, asked for a three days&apos; journey into the wilderness. But, again, when Moses had entreated God on Pharaoh&apos;s behalf, and the horde of wild beasts had vanished, the king hardened his heart, and did not let the people go.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The cessation of the fourth plague was as miraculous as the plague itself. The very animals that had been slain by the Egyptians in self-defense returned to life and departed from the land with the rest. This was ordained to prevent the wicked oppressors from profiting by the punishment even so much as the value of the hides and the flesh of the dead animals. It had not been so with the useless frogs, they had died on the spot, and their carcasses had remained where they fell.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The fifth plague inflicted by God upon the Egyptians was a grievous pestilence, which mowed down the cattle and beasts chiefly, yet it did not spare men altogether. This pestilence was a distinct plague, but it also accompanied all the other plagues, and the death of many Egyptians was due to it. The Israelites again came off unscathed. Indeed, if an Israelite had a just claim upon a beast held by an Egyptian, it, too, was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">spared, and the same good fortune waited upon such cattle as was the common property of Israelites and Egyptians.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The sixth plague, the plague of boils, was produced by Moses and Aaron together in a miraculous way. Each took a handful of ashes of the furnace, then Moses held the contents of the two heaps in the hollow of one of his hands, and sprinkled the ashes tip toward the heaven, and it flew so high that it reached the Divine throne. Returning earthward, it scattered over the whole land of Egypt, a space equal to four hundred square parasangs. The small dust of the ashes produced leprosy upon the skin of the Egyptians, and blains of a peculiar kind, soft within and dry on top.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The first five plagues the magicians had tried to imitate, and partly they had succeeded. But in this sixth plague they could not stand before Moses, and thenceforth they gave up the attempt to do as he did. Their craft had all along been harmful to themselves. Although they could produce the plagues, they could not imitate Moses in causing them to disappear. They would put their hands into their bosom, and draw them out white with leprosy, exactly like Moses, but their flesh remained leprous until the day of their death. And the same happened with all the other plagues that they imitated: until their dying day they were afflicted with the ills they produced.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Pharaoh had wittingly hardened his heart with each of the first five plagues, and refused to turn from his sinful purpose, God punished him thereafter in such wise that he could not mend his ways if he would. God said, &quot;Even though he should desire to do penance now, I will harden his heart until he pays off the whole of his debt.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Pharaoh had observed that whenever he walked on the brink of the Nile, Moses would intercept him. He therefore gave up his morning walk. But God bade Moses seek the king in his palace in the early hours of the day and urge him to repent of his evil ways. Therefore Moses spake to him as follows, in the name of God: &quot;O thou villain! Thou thinkest that I cannot destroy thee from the world. Consider, if I had desired it, instead of smiting the cattle, I might have smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence, and thou wouldst have been cut off from the earth. I inflicted the plague only in such degree as was necessary to show thee My power, and that My </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Name may be declared throughout all the earth. But thou dost not leave off treading My people underfoot. Behold, to-morrow when the sun passes this point,&quot;--whereat Moses made a stroke upon the wall--&quot;I will cause a very grievous hail to pour down, such as will be only once more, when I annihilate Gog with hail, fire, and brimstone.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">But God&apos;s lovingkindness is so great that even in His wrath He has mercy upon the wicked, and as His chief object was not to injure men and beasts, but to damage the vegetation in the fields of the Egyptians, He bade Moses admonish Pharaoh to send and hasten in his cattle and all that he had in the field. But the warning fell on heedless ears. Job was the only one to take it to heart, while Pharaoh and his people regarded not the word of the Lord. Therefore the Lord let the hail smite both man and beast, instead of confining it to the herbs and the trees of the field, as He had intended from the first.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As a rule, fire and water are elements at war with each other, but in the hailstones that smote the land of Egypt they were reconciled. A fire rested in the hailstones as the burning wick swims in the oil of a lamp; the surrounding fluid cannot extinguish the flame. The Egyptians were smitten either by the hail or by the fire. In the one case as the other their flesh was seared, and the bodies of the many that were slain by the hail were consumed by the fire. The hailstones heaped themselves up like a wall, so that the carcasses of the slain beasts could not be removed, and if the people succeeded in dividing the dead animals and carrying their flesh off, the birds of prey would attack them on their way home, and snatch their prize away. But the vegetation in the field suffered even more than man and beast, for the hail came down like an axe upon the trees and broke them. That the wheat and the spelt were not crushed was a miracle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now, at last, Pharaoh acknowledged, and said, &quot;The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. He was righteous when He bade us hasten in our cattle from before the hail, and I and my people were wicked, for we heeded not His warning, and men and beasts were found in the field by the hail, and slain.&quot; Again he begged Moses to supplicate God in his behalf, that He turn the plague away, and he promised to let the children of Israel go. Moses consented to do his will, saying, however: &quot;Think not that I do not know what will happen after the plague is stayed. I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">know that thou and thy servants, ye will fear the Lord God, once His punishment is removed, as little as ye feared Him before. But to show His greatness, I will pray to Him to make the hail to cease.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses went a short distance out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord, for he did not desire to pray to God within, where there were many idols and images. At once the hail remained suspended in the air. Part of it dropped down while Joshua was engaged in battle with the Amorites, and the rest God will send down in His fury against Gog. Also the thunders ceased at Moses&apos; intercession, and were stored up for a later time, for they were the noise which the Lord made the host of the Syrians to hear at the siege of Samaria, wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">As Moses had foreseen, so it happened. No sooner had the hail stopped than Pharaoh abandoned his resolve, and refused to let Israel go. Moses lost no time in announcing the eighth plague to him, the plague of the locusts. Observing that his words had made an impression upon the king&apos;s counsellors, he turned and went out from Pharaoh, to give them the opportunity of discussing the matter among themselves. And, indeed, his servants urged Pharaoh to let the Israelites go and serve the Lord their God. But, again, when Moses insisted that the whole people must go, the young and the old, the sons and the daughters, Pharaoh demurred, saying, &quot;I know it to be customary for young men and old men to take part in sacrifices, but surely not little children, and when you demand their presence, too, you betray your evil purpose. It is but a pretense, your saying that you will go a three days&apos; journey into the wilderness, and then return. You mean to escape and never come back. I will have nothing more to do with the matter. My god Baal-zephon will oppose you in the way, and hinder you on your journey.&quot; Pharaoh&apos;s last words were a dim presentiment. As a magician he foresaw that on their going forth from Egypt the children of Israel would find themselves in desperate straits before the sanctuary of Baal-zephon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Pharaoh was not content with merely denying the request preferred by Moses and Aaron. He ordered them to be forcibly expelled from the palace. Then God sent the plague of the locusts announced by Moses before. They ate every herb of the land, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and there remained not any green thing. And again Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, to ask their forgiveness, both for his sin against the Lord God, in not having hearkened unto His word, and for his sin against them, in having chased them forth and intended to curse them. Moses, as before, prayed to God in Pharaoh&apos;s behalf, and his petition was granted, the plague was taken away, and in a rather surprising manner. When the swarms of locusts began to darken the land, the Egyptians caught them and preserved them in brine as a dainty to be eaten. Now the Lord turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. Even those they were keeping in their pots flew up and away, and they had none of the expected profit.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The last plague but one, like those which had preceded it, endured seven days. All the time the land was enveloped in darkness, only it was not always of the same degree of density. During the first three days, it was not so thick but that the Egyptians could change their posture when they desired to do so. If they were sitting down, they could rise up, and if they were standing, they could sit down. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, the darkness was so dense that they could not stir from their place. They either sat the whole time, or stood; as they were at the beginning, so they remained until the end. The last day of darkness overtook the Egyptians, not in their own land, but at the Red Sea, on their pursuit of Israel. The darkness was not of the ordinary, earthly kind; it came from hell, and it could be felt. It was as thick as a dinar, and all the time it prevailed a celestial light brightened the dwellings of the children of Israel, whereby they could see what the Egyptians were doing under cover of the darkness. This was of great advantage to them, for when they were about to go forth from the land, and they asked their neighbors to lend them raiment, and jewels of gold and jewels of silver, for the journey, the Egyptians tried to deny having any in their possession. But the children of Israel, having spied out all their treasures during the days of darkness, could describe the objects they needed with accuracy, and designate their hiding-places. The Egyptians reasoned that the words of the Israelites could be taken implicitly as they spoke them, for if they had had any idea of deceiving them, asking for a loan when they intended to keep what they laid hands on, they might have taken unobserved during the days of darkness whatever: they </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">desired. Hence the Egyptians felt no hesitation in lending the children of Israel all the treasures they asked for.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be dispelled by artificial means. The light of the fire kindled for household uses was either extinguished by the violence of the storm, or else it was made invisible and swallowed up in the density of the darkness. Sight, that most indispensable of all the external senses, though unimpaired, was deprived of its office, for nothing could be discerned, and all the other senses were overthrown like subjects whose leader has fallen. None was able to speak or to hear, nor could anyone venture to take food, but they lay themselves down in quiet and hunger, their outward senses in a trance. Thus they remained, overwhelmed by the affliction, until Moses had compassion on them again, and besought God in their behalf, who granted him the power of restoring fine weather, light instead of darkness and day instead of night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Intimidated by this affliction, Pharaoh permitted the people to go, the little ones as well as the men and the women, only he asked that they let their flocks and their herds be stayed. But Moses said: &quot;As thou livest, our cattle also shall go with us. Yea, if but the hoof of an animal belongs to an Israelite, the beast shall not be left behind in Egypt.&quot; This speech exasperated Pharaoh to such a degree that he threatened Moses with death in the day he should see his face again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">At this very moment the Lord appeared unto Moses, and bade him inform Pharaoh of the infliction of the last plague, the slaying of the first-born. It was the first and the last time that God revealed Himself in the royal palace. He chose the residence of Pharaoh on this occasion that Moses might not be branded as a liar, for he had replied to Pharaoh&apos;s threat of killing him if he saw his face again, with the words, &quot;Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">With a loud voice Moses proclaimed the last plague, closing his announcement with the words: &quot;And all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out: and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out.&quot; Moses knew well enough that Pharaoh himself would come and urge him to lead Israel forth with as great haste as possible, but he mentioned </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">only the servants of the king, and not the king himself, because he never forgot the respect due to a ruler.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">“Therefore, say to the people of Isra’el: ‘I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">.

The magicians tried with their secret arts to produce lice, but they couldn’t. There were lice on people and animals.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the time approached in which, according to the promise made to Abraham, his children would be redeemed, it was seen that they had no pious deeds to their credit for the sake of which they deserved release from bondage. God therefore gave them two commandments, one bidding them to sacrifice the paschal lamb and one to circumcise their sons. Along with the first they received the calendar in use among </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the Jews, for the Passover feast is to be celebrated on the fifteenth day of the month of Nisan, and with this month the year is to begin. But the computations for the calendar are so involved that Moses could not understand them until God showed him the movements of the moon plainly. There were three other things equally difficult, which Moses could comprehend only after God made him to see them plainly. They were the compounding of the holy anointing oil, the construction of the candlestick in the Tabernacle, and the animals the flesh of which is permitted or prohibited. Also the determination of the new moon was the subject of special Divine teaching. That Moses might know the exact procedure, God appeared to him in a garment with fringes upon its corners, bade Moses stand at His right hand and Aaron at His left, and then, citing Michael and Gabriel as witnesses, He addressed searching questions to the angels as to how the new moon had seemed to them. Then the Lord addressed Moses and Aaron, saying, &quot;Thus shall My children proclaim the new moon, on the testimony of two witnesses and through the president of the court.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses appeared before the children of Israel and delivered the Divine message to them, telling them that their redemption would come about in this month of Nisan, they said: &quot;How is it possible that we should be redeemed? Is not the whole of Egypt full of our idols? And we have no pious deeds to show making us worthy of redemption.&quot; Moses made reply, and said: &quot;As God desires your redemption, He pays no heed to your idols; He passes them by. Nor does He look upon your evil deeds, but only upon the good deeds of the pious among you.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">God would not, indeed, have delivered Israel if they had not abandoned their idol worship. Unto this purpose He commanded them to sacrifice the paschal lamb. Thus they were to show that they had given up the idolatry of the Egyptians, consisting in the worship of the ram. The early law was different from the practice of later times, for they were bidden to select their sacrificial animal four days before the day appointed for the offering, and to designate it publicly as such, to show that they did not stand in awe of the Egyptians.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>With a heavy heart the Egyptians watched the preparations of the Israelites for sacrificing the animals they worshipped. Yet they did not dare interpose an objection, and when the time came for the offering to be made, the children of Israel could perform the ceremonies without a tremor, seeing that they knew, through many days&apos; experience, that the Egyptians feared to approach them with hostile intent. There was another practice connected with the slaughter of the paschal lamb that was to show the Egyptians how little the Israelites feared them. They took of the blood of the animal, and openly put it on the two side posts and on the lintel of the doors of their houses.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moses communicated the laws regulating the Passover sacrifice to the elders, and they in turn made them known to the people at large. The elders were commended for having supported the leader at his first appearance, for their faith in Moses caused the whole people to adhere to him at once. Therefore God spake, saying: &quot;I will reward the elders for inspiring the people with confidence in Moses. They shall have the honor of delivering Israel. They shall lead the people to the Passover sacrifice, and through this the redemption will be brought about.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The ceremonies connected with the Passover sacrifice had the purpose of conveying instruction to Israel about the past and the future alike. The blood put on the two side posts and on the lintel of their doors was to remind them of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the bunch of hyssop for sprinkling the blood on the doors was to imply that, although Israel&apos;s position among the peoples of the earth is as lowly as that of the hyssop among the plants, yet this little nation is bound together like the bunch of hyssop, for it is God&apos;s peculiar treasure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The paschal sacrifice afforded Moses the opportunity for inducing the children of Israel to submit themselves to circumcision, which many had refused to do until then in spite of his urgent appeals. But God has means of persuasion. He caused a wind to blow that wafted the sweet scents of Paradise toward Moses&apos; paschal lamb, and the fragrance penetrated to all parts of Egypt, to the distance of a forty days&apos; journey. The people were attracted in crowds to Moses&apos; lamb, and desired to partake of it. But he said, &quot;This is the command of God, &apos;No uncircumcised person shall eat thereof,&apos;&quot; and they all decided to undergo circumcision. When the Lord passed through the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">land of Egypt, He blessed every Israelite for his fulfilment of the two commands, the command of the paschal sacrifice and the command regarding circumcision.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The Lord performed a great miracle for the Israelites. As no sacrifice may be eaten beyond the borders of the Holy Land, all the children of Israel were transported thither on clouds, and after they had eaten of the sacrifice, they were carried back to Egypt in the same way.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The people took their dough before it had become leavened and wrapped their kneading bowls in their clothes on their shoulders.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The people of Isra’el traveled from Ra‘amses to Sukkot, some six hundred thousand men on foot, not counting children.

   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4"><text:soft-page-break/>Haggada - The Smiting Of The First-born</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">When Moses announced the slaying of the first-born, the designated victims all repaired to their fathers, and said: &quot;Whatever Moses hath foretold has been fulfilled. Let the Hebrews go, else we shall all die.&quot; But the fathers replied, &quot;It is better for one of every ten of us to die, than the Hebrews should execute their purpose.&quot; Then the first-born repaired to Pharaoh, to induce him to dismiss the children of Israel. So far from granting their wish, he ordered his servants to fall upon the first-born and beat them, to punish them for their presumptuous demand. Seeing that they could not accomplish their end by gentle means, they attempted to bring it about by force.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Pharaoh and all that opposed the wishes of the first-born were of the opinion that the loss of so inconsiderable a percentage of the population was a matter of small moment. They were mistaken in their calculation, for the Divine decree included not only the first-born sons, but also the first-born daughters, and not only the first-born of the marriages then existing, but also the first-born issuing from previous alliances of the fathers and the mothers, and as the Egyptians led dissolute lives, it happened not rarely that each of the ten children of one woman was the first-born of its father. Finally, God decreed that death should smite the oldest member of every household, whether or not he was the first-born of his parents. What God resolves is executed. At the exact instant marking the middle of the night, so precise that only God Himself could determine and discern it, He appeared in Egypt, attended by nine thousand myriads of the Angels of Destruction who are fashioned some of hail and some of flames, and whose glances drive terror and trembling to the heart of the beholder. These angels were about to precipitate themselves into the work of annihilation, but God restrained them, saying, &quot;My wrath will not be appeased until I Myself execute vengeance upon the enemies of Israel.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Those among the Egyptians who gave credence to Moses&apos; words, and tried to shield their first-born children from death, sent them to their Hebrew neighbors, to spend the fateful night with them, in the hope that God would exempt the houses of the children of Israel from the plague. But in the morning, when the Israelites arose from their sleep, they found the corpses of the Egyptian fugitives next to them. That was the night in which the Israelites prayed before lying down to sleep: &quot;Cause us, O Lord </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">our God, to lie down in peace, remove Satan from before us and from behind us, and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace,&quot; for it was Satan that had caused frightful bloodshed among the Egyptians.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Among the slain there were, beside the Egyptian first-born, also the first-born of other nationalities residing in Egypt, as well as the Egyptian first-born dwelling outside of their own land. Even the long dead of the first-born were not spared. The dogs dragged their corpses out of their graves in the houses, for it was the Egyptian custom to inter the dead at home. At the appalling sight the Egyptians mourned as though the bereavement had befallen them but recently. The very monuments and statues erected to the memory of the first-born dead were changed into dust, which was scattered and flew out of sight. Moreover, their slaves had to share the fate of the Egyptians, and no less the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon, for none was so low but he hated the Hebrews, and rejoiced when the Egyptians decreed their persecution. The female slaves that ground corn between mill-stones were in the habit of saying, &quot;We do not regret our servitude, if only the Israelites are gagged, too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In dealing out punishment to these aliens in the land of Egypt, God showed that He was at once the Master of the land and the Lord over all the gods of the nations, for if the slaves and the captives of war had not been smitten, they would have said, &quot;Mighty is our god, who helped us in this plague.&quot; For the same reason all the idols of the Egyptians were swept out of existence in that night. The stone idols were ground into dust, the wooden idols rotted, and those made of metal melted away, and so the Egyptians were kept from ascribing their chastisement to the wrath of their own gods. Likewise the Lord God slew the first-born of the cattle, for the Egyptians paid worship to animals, and they would have attributed their misfortunes to them. In all these ways the Lord showed them that their gods were but vanity.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Pharaoh and the Egyptians let their dead lie unburied, while they hastened to help the Israelites load their possessions on wagons, to get them out of the land with as little delay as possible. When they left, they took with them, beside their own cattle, the sheep and the oxen that Pharaoh had ordered his nobles to give them as presents. The king also forced his magnates to beg pardon of the Israelites for all they had suffered, knowing as he did that God forgives an injury done by man to his fellow only after the wrong-doer has recovered the good-will of his victim by confessing and regretting his fault. &quot;Now, depart!&quot; said Pharaoh to the Israelites, &quot;I want nothing from you but that you should pray to God for me, that I may be saved from death.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The hatred of the Egyptians toward the Israelites changed now into its opposite. They conceived affection and friendship for them, and fairly forced raiment upon them, and jewels of silver and jewels of gold, to take along with them on their journey, although the children of Israel had not yet returned the articles they had borrowed from their neighbors at an earlier time. This action is in part to be explained by the vanity of Pharaoh and his people. They desired to pretend before the world that they were vastly rich, as everybody would conclude when this wealth of their mere slaves was displayed to observers. Indeed, the Israelites bore so much away from Egypt that one of them alone might have defrayed the expense of building and furnishing the Tabernacle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">On their leaving the land only the private wealth of the Egyptians was in their hands, but when they arrived at the Red Sea they came into possession of the public treasure, too, for Pharaoh, like all kings, carried the moneys of the state with him on his campaigns, in order to be prepared to hire a relay of mercenaries in case of defeat. Great as the other treasure was, the booty captured at the sea far exceeded it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">But if the Israelites loaded themselves down with goods and jewels and money, it was not to gratify love of riches, or, as any usurer might say, because they coveted their neighbors&apos; possessions. In the first place they could look upon their plunder as wages due to them from those they had long served, and, secondly, they were entitled to retaliate on those at whose hands they had suffered wrong. Even then they were requiting them with an affliction far slighter than any one of all they had endured themselves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The plagues did not stay the cruelty of the Egyptian oppressors toward the Hebrews. It continued unabated until the very end of their sojourn in the land. On the day of the exodus, Rachel the daughter of Shuthelah gave birth to a child, while she and her husband together <text:soft-page-break/>were treading the clay for bricks. The babe dropped from her womb into the clay and sank out of sight. Gabriel appeared, moulded a brick out of the clay containing the child, and carried it to the highest of the heavens, where he made it a footstool before the Divine throne. In that night it was that God looked upon the suffering of Israel, and smote the first-born of the Egyptians, and it is one of the four nights that God has inscribed in the Book of Memorial. The first of the four is that in which God appeared to create the world; all was waste and void, and darkness brooded over the abyss, until the Lord came and spread light round about by His word. The second night is that in which God appeared unto Abraham at the covenant of the pieces. In the third night He appeared in Egypt, slaying the first-born of the Egyptians with His right hand, and protecting the first-born of the Israelites with His left. The fourth night recorded will be that in which the end of the redemption will be accomplished, when the iron yoke of the wicked kingdom will be broken, and the evil-doers will be destroyed. Then will Moses come from the desert, and the Messiah from Rome, each at the head of his flock, and the word of God will mediate between them, causing both to walk with one accord in the same direction.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Israel&apos;s redemption in future days will happen on the fifteenth of Nisan, the night of Israel&apos;s redemption from Egypt, for thus did Moses say, &quot;In this night God protected Israel against the Angels of Destruction, and in this night He will also redeem the generations of the future.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">T<text:span text:style-name="T24">h</text:span>ough the actual deliverance from Egypt took place in that night, the Hebrews did not leave the land until the following day.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">During the same night God requited the Egyptians for their evil deeds in the sight of all the people, the night being as bright as day at the time of the summer solstice. Not one could escape the general chastisement, for by Divine dispensation none was absent from home at the time, so that none could fail to see the chastisement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The angels in heaven learnt what was happening on earth. When they were about to begin their song of praise to God, He silenced them with the words, &quot;My children on earth are singing now,&quot; and the celestial hosts had to stop and listen to the song of Israel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Great as the joy of the Hebrews was at their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, it was exceeded by that of Pharaoh&apos;s people at seeing their slaves depart, for with them went the dread of death that had obsessed them. They were like the portly gentleman riding an ass. The rider feels uncomfortable and longs for the moment of alighting, but his longing cannot compare in intensity with that of the ass groaning under the corpulent burden, and when <text:soft-page-break/>their journey&apos;s end is reached, the ass rejoices more than his master. So the Egyptians were happier to be rid of the Hebrews than these were to be free.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">In general, the Israelites were not in a joyous mood. The strength of men is readily exhausted, mentally and physically, by the strain of a sudden change from slavery to freedom. They did not recover vigor and force until they heard the angel hosts sing songs of praise and joy over the redemption of Israel and the redemption of the Shekinah, for so long as the chosen people is in exile, the Shekinah, who dwells among Israel, is also, as it were, in exile. At the same time, God caused the earth to exhale and send aloft a healing fragrance, which cured them of all their diseases.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The exodus of the Israelites began at Raamses, and although the distance from there to the city of Mizraim, where Moses abode, was a forty days&apos; journey, yet they heard the voice of their leader urging them to leave the land. They covered the distance from Raamses to Succoth, a three days&apos; march, in an instant. In Succoth God enveloped them in seven clouds of glory, four hovering in front, behind, and at the two sides of them, one suspended above them, to keep off rain, hail, and the rays of the sun, and one under them to protect them against thorns and snakes. The seventh cloud preceded them, and prepared the way for them, exalting the valleys and making low every mountain and hill. Thus they wandered through the wilderness for forty years. In all that time no artificial lighting was needed; a beam from the celestial cloud followed them into the darkest of chambers, and if one of the people had to go outside of the camp, even thither he was accompanied by a fold of the cloud, covering and protecting him. Only, that a difference might be made between day and night, a pillar of fire took the place of the cloud in the evening. Never for an instant were the people without the one or the other to guide them: the pillar of fire glowed in front of them before the pillar of cloud retired, and in the morning the cloud was there before the fire vanished. The clouds of glory and the pillar of fire were sent for the protection of Israel alone, for none beside, not for the heathen and not for the mixed multitude that went up with them; these had to walk outside of the cloud enclosure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The cavalcade consisted of six hundred thousand heads of families afoot, each accompanied by five children on horseback, and to these must be added the mixed multitude, exceeding the Hebrews vastly in number.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">So profound was Israel&apos;s trust in the Lord, that they followed Moses unmurmuringly into the wilderness, without supplying themselves with provisions. The only edibles they took were the remains of the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, and these not to satisfy their <text:soft-page-break/>hunger, but because they were unwilling to separate themselves from what they had prepared lovingly at the command of God. These possessions were so dear to them that they would not entrust them to the beasts of burden, they carried them on their own shoulders.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P76" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Redemption Of Israel From Egyptian Bondage</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Pharaoh rose up in the night of the smiting of the first-born. He waited not for the third hour of the morning, when kings usually arise, nor did he wait to be awakened, but he himself roused his slaves from their slumber, and all the other Egyptians, and together they went forth to seek Moses and Aaron. He knew that Moses had never spoken an untruth, and as he had said, &quot;I will see thy face again no more,&quot; he could not count upon Moses&apos; coming to him. There remained nothing for him to do but go in search of the Israelitish leader. He did not know where Moses lived, and he had great difficulty and lost much time in looking for his house, for the Hebrew lads of whom he made inquiries when he met them in the street played practical jokes on him, misdirected him, and led him astray. Thus he wandered about a long time. all the while weeping and crying out, &quot;O my friend Moses, pray for me to God!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Meanwhile Moses and Aaron and all Israel beside were at the paschal meal, drinking wine as they sat and leaned to one side, and singing songs in praise of God, the Hallel, which they were the first to recite. When Pharaoh finally reached the door of the house wherein Moses abode, he called to him, and from Moses the question came back, &quot;Who art thou, and what is thy name?&quot;--&quot;I am Pharaoh, who stands here humiliated.&quot;--Moses asked again: &quot;Why dost thou come to me thyself? Is it the custom of kings to linger at the doors of common folk?&quot;--&quot;I pray thee, my lord,&quot; returned Pharaoh, &quot;come forth and intercede for us, else there will not remain a single being in Egypt.&quot;--&quot;I may not come forth, for God bath commanded us, &apos;None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.&apos;&quot; --But Pharaoh continued to plead: &quot;Do but step to the window, and speak with me,&quot; and when Moses yielded to his importunities, and appeared at the window, the king addressed these words to him: &quot;Thou didst say yesterday, &apos;All the first-born in the land of Egypt will die,&apos; but now as many as nine-tenths of the inhabitants have perished.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Pharaoh was accompanied by his daughter Bithiah, Moses&apos; foster-mother. She reproached him with ingratitude, in having brought down evil upon her and her countrymen. And Moses answered, and said: &quot;Ten plagues the Lord brought upon Egypt. Hath evil accrued to thee from any of them? Did one of them affect thee?&quot; And when Bithiah acknowledged that no harm had touched her, Moses continued to speak, &quot;Although thou art thy mother&apos;s first-born, <text:soft-page-break/>thou shalt not die, and no evil shall reach thee in the midst of Egypt.&quot; But Bithiah said, &quot;Of what advantage is my security to me, when I see the king, my brother, and all his household, and his servants in this evil plight, and look upon their first-born perishing with all the first-born of Egypt?&quot; And Moses returned, &quot;Verily, thy brother and his household and the other Egyptians would not hearken to the words of the Lord, therefore did this evil come upon them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Turning to Pharaoh, Moses said: &quot;In spite of all that hath happened, I will teach thee something, if thou desirest to learn, and thou wilt be spared, and thou wilt not die. Raise thy voice, and say: &apos;Ye children of Israel, ye are your own masters. Prepare for your journey, and depart from among my people. Hitherto ye were the slaves of Pharaoh, but henceforward ye are under the authority of God. Serve the Lord your God!&apos;&quot; Moses made him say these words three times, and God caused Pharaoh&apos;s voice to be heard throughout the land of Egypt, so that all the inhabitants, the home-born and the aliens, knew that Pharaoh had released the children of Israel from the bondage in which they had languished. And all Israel sang, &quot;Hallelujah, praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the Name of the Lord,&quot; for they belonged to the Lord, and no more were the servants of Pharaoh.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Long Route</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The exodus would have been impossible if Joseph&apos;s bones had remained behind. Therefore Moses made it his concern to seek their resting-place, while the people had but the one thought of gathering in the treasures of the Egyptians. But it was not an easy matter to find Joseph&apos;s body. Moses knew that he had been interred in the mausoleum of the Egyptian kings, but there were so many other bodies there that it was impossible to identify it. Moses&apos; mother Jochebed came to his aid. She led him to the very spot where Joseph&apos;s bones lay. As soon as he came near them, he knew them to be what he was seeking, by the fragrance they exhaled and spread around. But his difficulties were not at an end. The question arose, how he was to secure possession of the remains. Joseph&apos;s coffin had been sunk far down into the ground, and he knew not how to raise it from the depths. Standing at the edge of the grave, he spoke these words. &quot;Joseph, the time hath come whereof thou didst say, &apos;God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.&apos;&quot; No sooner had this reminder dropped from his lips than the coffin stirred and rose to the surface.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">And even yet the difficulties in Moses&apos; way were not removed wholly. The Egyptian magicians had stationed two golden dogs at Joseph&apos;s coffin, to keep watch,. and they barked vehemently if anyone ventured close to it. The noise they made was so loud it could <text:soft-page-break/>be heard throughout the land, from end to end, a distance equal to a forty day&apos;s journey. When Moses came near the coffin, the dogs emitted their warning sound, but he silenced them at once with words, &quot;Come, ye people, and behold the miracle! The real, live dogs did not bark, and these counterfeit dogs produced by magic attempt it!&quot; What he said about real, live dogs and their refraining from barking had reference to the fact that the dogs of the Egyptians did not move their tongues against any of the children of Israel, through they had barked all the time the people were engaged in burying the bodies of their smitten first-born. As a reward God gave the Israelites the law, to cast to the dogs the flesh they themselves are forbidden to eat, for the Lord withholds due recompense from none of His creatures. Indeed, the dogs received a double reward, for their excrements are used in tanning the hides from which the Torah scrolls are made, as well as the Mezuzot and the phylacteries.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Joseph&apos;s coffin in the possession of Moses, the march of the Israelites could begin. The Egyptians put no manner of obstacle in their way. Pharaoh himself accompanied them, to make sure that they were actually leaving the land, and now he was so angry at his counselors for having advised against letting the Israelites depart that he slew them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">For several reasons God did not permit the Israelites to travel along the straight route to the promised land. He desired them to go to Sinai first and take the law upon themselves there, and, besides, the time divinely appointed for the occupation of the land by the Gentiles had not yet elapsed. Over and above all this, the long sojourn in the wilderness was fraught with profit for the Israelites, spiritually and materially. If they had reached Palestine directly after leaving Egypt, they would have devoted themselves entirely each to the cultivation of his allotted parcel of ground, and no time would have been left for the study of the Torah. In the wilderness they were relieved of the necessity of providing for their daily wants, and they would give all their efforts to acquiring the law. On the whole, it would not have been advantageous to process at once to the Holy Land and take possession thereof, for when the Canaanites heard that the Israelites were making for Palestine, they burnt the crops, felled the trees, destroyed the buildings, and choked the water springs, all in order to render the land uninhabitable. Hereupon God spake, and said: &quot;I did not promise their fathers to give a devastated land unto their see, but a land full of all good things. I will lead them about in the wilderness for forty years, and meanwhile the Canaanites will have time to repair the damage they have done.&quot; Moreover, the many miracles preformed for the Israelites during the journey through the wilderness had made their terror to fall upon the other nations, and their hearts melted, and there remained no more spirit in any man. They did not venture to attack the Israelites, and the conquest of the land was all the easier.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/>Nor does this exhaust the list of reasons for preferring the longer route through the desert. Abraham had sworn a solemn oath to live at peace with the Philistines during a certain period, and the end of the term had not yet arrived. Besides, there was the fear that the sight of the land of the Philistines would awaken sad recollections in the Israelites, and drive them back into Egypt speedily, for once upon a time it had been the scene of a bitter disappointment to them. they had spent one hundred and eighty years in Egypt, in peace and prosperity, not in the least molested by the people. Suddenly Ganon came, a descendant of Joseph, of the tribe of Ephraim, and he spake, &quot;The Lord hat appeared unto me, and He bade me lead you forth out of Egypt.&quot; The Ephraimites were the only ones to heed his words. Proud of their royal lineage as direct descendants of Joseph, and confident to their valor in war, for they were great heroes, they left the land and betook themselves to Palestine. They Carried only weapons and gold and silver. They had taken no provisions, because they expected to buy food and drink on the way or capture them by force if the owners would not part with them for money.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">After a day&apos;s march they found themselves in the neighborhood of Gath, at the place where the shepherds employed by the residents of the city gathered with the flocks. the Ephraimites asked them to sell them some sheep, which they expected to slaughter in order to satisfy their hunger with them, but the shepherds refused to have business dealings with them, saying, &quot;Are the sheep ours, or does the cattle belong to us, that we could part with them for money?&quot; Seeing that they could not gain their point by kindness, the Ephraimites used force. The outcries of the shepherds brought the people of Gath to their aid. A violent encounter, lasting a whole day, took place between the Israelites and the Philistines. The people of Gath realized that alone they would not be able to offer successful resistance to the Ephraimites, and they summoned the people of the other Philistine cities to join them. The following day an army of forty thousand stood ready to oppose the Ephraimites. Reduced in strength, as they were, by their three days&apos; fast, they were exterminated root and branch. Only ten of them escaped with their bare life, and returned to Egypt, to bring Ephraim word of the disaster that had overtaken his posterity, and he mourned many days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">This abortive attempt of the Ephraimites to leave Egypt was the first occasion for oppressing Israel. Thereafter the Egyptians exercised force and vigilance to keep them in their land. As for the disaster of the Ephraimites, it was well-merited punishment, because they had paid no heed to the wish of the father Joseph, who had adjured his descendants solemnly on his deathbed not to think of quitting the land until the redeemer should appear. Their death was <text:soft-page-break/>followed by disgrace, for their bodies lay unburied for many years on the battlefield near Gath, and the purpose of God in directing the Israelites to choose the longer route from Egypt to Canaan, was to spare them the sight of those dishonored corpses. Their courage might have deserted them, and out of apprehension of sharing the fate of their brethren they might have hastened back to the land of slavery.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Now the king of Egypt insisted upon their leaving the land without delay. But Moses objected, and said: &quot;Are we thieves, that we should slink away under cover of the night? Wait until morning.&quot; Pharaoh, however, urged and begged Moses to depart, confessing that he was anxious about his own person, for he was a first-born son, and he was terrified that death would strike him down, too. Moses dissipated his alarm, though he substituted a new horror, with the words, &quot;Fear not, there is worse in store for thee!&quot; Dread seized upon the whole people; every one of the Egyptians was afraid of losing his life, and they all united their prayers with Pharaoh&apos;s, and begged Moses to take the Israelites hence. And God spake, Ye shall all find your end, not here, but in the Red Sea!&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">After Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not guide them to the highway that goes through the land of the P’lishtim, because it was close by — God thought that the people, upon seeing war, might change their minds and return to Egypt. Rather, God led the people by a roundabout route, through the desert by the Sea of Suf. The people of Isra’el went up from the land of Egypt fully armed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him, for Yosef had made the people of Isra’el swear an oath when he said, “God will certainly remember you; and you are to carry my bones up with you, away from here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T15">They traveled from Sukkot and set up camp in Etam, at the edge of the desert. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> went ahead of them in a column of cloud during the daytime to lead them on their way, and at night in a column of fire to give them light; thus they could travel both by day and by night.

   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Pharaoh Pursues The Hebrews</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Pharaoh permitted Israel to depart, he was under the impression that they were going only a three days&apos; journey into the wilderness for the purpose of offering sacrifices. He sent officers with them, whose duty was to bring them back at the appointed time. The exodus took place on a Thursday. On the following Sunday the king&apos;s watchers noticed that the Israelites, so far from preparing for a return, were making arrangements looking to a long sojourn in the desert. They remonstrated and urged them to go back. The Israelites maintained that Pharaoh had dismissed them for good, but the officers would not be put off with their mere assertions. They said, &quot;Willy-nilly, you will have to do as the powers that be command.&quot; To such arrogance the Israelites would not submit, and they fell upon the officers, slaying some and wounding others. The maimed survivors went back to Egypt, and report the contumacy of the Israelites to Pharaoh. Meantime Moses, who did not desire the departure of his people to have the appearance of flight before the Egyptians, gave the signal to turn back to Pi-hahiroth. Those of little faith among the Israelites tore their hair and their garments in desperation, though Moses assured them that by the word of God they were free men, and no longer slaves to Pharaoh. Accordingly, they retraced their steps to Pi-hahiroth, where two rectangular rocks form an opening, within which the great sanctuary of Baal-zephon was situated. The rocks are shaped like human figures, the one a man and the other a woman, and they were not chiseled by human hands, but by the Creator Himself. The place had been called Pithom in earlier times, but later, on account of the idols set up there, it received the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">name Hahiroth. Of set purpose God had left Baal-zephon uninjured, alone of all the Egyptian idols. He wanted the Egyptian people to think that this idol was possessed of exceeding might, which it exercised to prevent the Israelites from journeying on. To confirm them in their illusory belief, God caused wild beasts to obstruct the road to the wilderness, and they took it for granted that their idol Baal-zephon had ordained their appearance.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Pi-hahiroth was famous, besides, on account of the treasures heaped up there. The wealth of the world which Joseph had acquired through the sale of corn he had stored up during the seven years of plenty, he had divided into three parts. The first part he surrendered to Pharaoh. The second part he concealed in the wilderness, where it was found by Korah, though it disappeared again, not to come to view until the Messianic time, and then it will be for the benefit of the pious. The third part Joseph hid in the sanctuary of Baal-zephon, whence the Hebrews carried it off as booty.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Amalek and the magicians brought the information to Pharaoh, that the Israelites had resolved not to return to Egypt, his heart and the heart of his whole people turned against them. The very counselors that had persuaded him to dismiss the children of Israel spake now as follows: &quot; If we had only been smitten with the plaques, we could have resigned ourselves to our fate. Or if, besides being smitten with the plagues, we had been compelled to let the Hebrews depart from the land, that, too, we could have been borne with patience. But to be smitten with the plagues, to be compelled to let our slaves depart from us, and to sit by and see them go off with our riches, that is more than we can endure.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now that the children of Israel had gone from them the Egyptians recognized how valuable an element they had been in their country. In general, the time of the exodus of Israel was disastrous for their former masters. In addition to losing their dominion over the Israelites, the Egyptians had to deal with mutinies that broke out among many other nations tributary to them, for hitherto Pharaoh had been the ruler of the whole world. The king resorted to blandishments and promises, to induce the people to make war against the Israelites, saying, &quot;As a rule the army marches forth first, and the king follows in security, but I will precede you; and as a rule the king has the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">first choice of the booty, and as much of it as he desires, but I will take no more than any one of you, and on my return from the war I will divide my treasures of silver, gold, and precious stones among you.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In his zeal Pharaoh did not wait to have his chariot made ready for him he did it with his own hands, and his nobles followed his example. Samael granted Pharaoh assistance, putting six hundred chariots manned with his own hosts at his disposal. These formed the vanguard, and they were joined by all the Egyptians, with their vast assemblages of chariots and warriors, no less than three hundred of their men to one of the children of Israel, each equipped with their different sorts of weapons. The general custom was for two charioteers to take turns at driving a car, but to overtake the Israelites more surely and speedily, Pharaoh ordered three to be assigned to each. The result was that they covered in one day the ground which it had taken the Israelites three to traverse.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The mind of the Egyptians was in no wise directed toward spoil and plunder in this expedition. Their sole and determined purpose was to exterminate Israel, kith and kin. As the heathen lay great stress upon omens when they are about to start out on a campaign, God caused all their preparations to proceed smoothly, without the slightest untoward circumstance. Everything pointed to a happy issue. Pharaoh, himself an adept in magic, had a presentiment that dire misfortune would befall the children of Israel in the wilderness, that they would lose Moses there, and there the whole generation that had departed from Egypt would find its grave. Therefore he spoke to Dathan and Abiram, who remained behind in Egypt, saying: &quot;Moses is leading them, but he himself knows not whither. Verily, the congregation of Israel will lift up their voice in the wilderness, and cry, and there they will be destroyed.&quot; He thought naturally that these visions had reference to an imminent future, to the time of his meeting with his dismissed slaves. But his error was profound-he was hurrying forward to his own destruction.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When he reached the sanctuary of Baal-zephon, Pharaoh, in his joy at finding him spared while all the other idols in Egypt had been annihilated, lost no time, but hastened to offer sacrifices to him, and he was comforted, &quot;for,&quot; he said, &quot;Baal-zephon approves my purpose of drowning the children of Israel in the sea.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the Israelites beheld the huge detachments of the Egyptian army moving upon them, and when they considered that in Migdol there were other troops stationed, besides, more, indeed, than their own numbers, men, women, and children all told, great terror overwhelmed them. What affrighted them most, was the sight of the Angel of Egypt darting through the air as he flew to the assistance of the people under his tutelage. They turned to Moses, saying: &quot;What has thou done to us? Now they will requite us for all that hath happened-that their first-born were smitten, and that we ran off with their money, which was thy fault, for thou didst bid up borrow gold and silver from our Egyptian neighbors and depart with their property.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The situation of the Israelites was desperate. Before them was the sea, behind them the Egyptians, on both sides the wild beasts of the desert. The wicked among them spoke to Moses, saying, &quot;While we were in Egypt, we said to thee and to Aaron, &apos;The Lord look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.&apos; Then there died many of our brethren during the days of darkness, which was worse than the bondage in which the Egyptians kept us. Nevertheless our fate in the desert will be sadder than theirs. They at least were mourned, and their bodies ere buried, but our corpses will lie exposed, consumed in the day by drought and by frost in the night.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses in his wisdom knew how to pacify the thousands and myriads under his leadership. He impressed them with the words, &quot;Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.&quot; &quot;When will His salvation come?&quot; questioned the people, and he told them it would appear the following day, but they protested, &quot;We cannot wait until to-morrow.&quot; Then Moses prayed to God, and the Lord showed him the angel hosts standing ready to hasten to the assistance of the people.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">They were not agreed as to what they were to do. There were four contending parties. The opinion of the first party was that they seek death by drowning in the sea; of the second, that they return to Egypt; the third was in favor of a pitched battle with the enemy, and the fourth thought it would be a good plan to intimidate the Egyptians by noise and a great hubbub. To the first Moses said, &quot;Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord;&quot; to the second, &quot;The Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">ye shall see them again no more forever;&quot; to the third, &quot;The Lord shall fight for you;&quot; and to the fourth, &quot;Ye shall hold your peace.&quot; &quot;What, then, shall we do?&quot; these asked their leader, and Moses answered them, saying, &quot;Ye shall bless, praise, extol, adore and glorify Him that is the Lord of war!&quot; Instead of the sword and the five sorts of arms which they bore, they mad use of their mouth, and it was of greater avail than all possible weapons of war. The Lord hearkened unto their prayer, for which He had but been waiting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses also addressed himself to God, saying: &quot;O Lord of the world! I am like the shepherd who, having undertaken to pasture a flock, has been heedless enough to drive his sheep to the edge of a precipice, and then is in a despair how to get them down again. Pharaoh is behind my flock Israel, in the south is Baal-zephon, in the north Midgol, and before us the sea lies spread out. Thou knowest, O Lord, that it is beyond human strength and human contrivance to surmount the difficulties standing in our way. Thine alone is the work of procuring deliverance for this army, which left Egypt at Thy appointment. We despair of all other assistance or device, and we have recourse only to our hope in Thee. If there be any escape possible, we look up to Thy providence to accomplish it for us.&quot; With such words Moses continued to make fervent supplication to God to succor Israel in their need. But God cut short his prayer, saying: &quot;Moses, My children are in distress-the sea blocks the way before them, the enemy is in hot pursuit after them, and thou standest here and prayest. Sometimes long prayer is good, but sometimes it is better to be brief. If I gathered the waters together unto one place, and let the dry land appear for Adam, a single human being, should I not do the same for this holy congregation? I will save them if only for the sake of the merits of Abraham, who stood ready to sacrifice his son Isaac unto Me, and for the sake of My promise to Jacob. The sun and the moon are witnesses that I will cleave the sea for the seed of the children of Israel, who deserve My help for going after Me in the wilderness unquestioningly. Do thou but see to it that they abandon their evil thought of returning to Egypt, and then it will not be necessary to turn to Me and entreat My help.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses, however, was still very much troubled in mind, on account of Samael, who had not left off lodging accusations before God against Israel since the exodus from Egypt. The Lord adopted the same procedure in dealing with the accuser as the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">experienced shepherd, who, at the moment of transferring his sheep across a stream, was faced by a ravening wolf. The shepherd threw a strong ram to the wolf, and while the two engaged in combat, the rest of the flock was carried across the water, and then the shepherd returned and snatch the wolf&apos;s supposed prey away from him. Samael said to the Lord: &quot;Up to this time the children of Israel were idol worshippers, and now Thou proposest so great a thing as dividing the sea for them?&quot; What did the Lord do? He surrendered Job to Samael, saying, &quot;While he busies himself with Job, Israel will pass through the sea unscathed, and as soon as they are in safety, I will rescue Job from the hands of Samael.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Israel had other angel adversaries, besides. Uzza, the tutelary Angel of the Egyptians, appeared before God, and said, &quot;O Lord of the world! I have a suit with this nation which Thou hast brought forth out to Egypt. If it seemeth well to Thee, let their angel Michael appear, and contend with me before Thee.&quot; The Lord summoned Michael, and Uzza stated his charges against Israel: &quot;O Lord of the world! Thou didst decree concerning this people of Israel that is hall be held in bondage by my people, the Egyptians, for a period of four hundred years. But they had dominion over them only eighty-six years, therefore the time of their going forth hath not yet arrived. If it be Thy will, give me permission to take them back to Egypt, that they may continue in slavery for the three hundred and fourteen years that are left, and Thy word be fulfilled. As Thou are immutable, so let Thy decree be immutable!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Michael was silent, for he knew not how to controvert these words, and it seemed as if Uzza had won his suit. But the Lord Himself espoused the cause of Israel, and He said to Uzza: &quot;The duty of serving thy nation was laid upon My children only on account of an unseemly word uttered by Abraham. When I spoke to him, saying, &apos;I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it,&apos; he made answer, &apos;Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?&apos; Therefore did I say to him, &apos;Thy seed shall be a stranger.&apos; But it is well-known and manifest before Me that they were &apos;strangers&apos; from the day of Isaac&apos;s birth, and. reckoning thence, the period of four hundred years has elapsed, and thou hast no right to keep My children in bondage any longer.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4"><text:soft-page-break/>Exodus Continued...</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people. They said, “What have we done, letting Isra’el stop being our slaves?” So he prepared his chariots and took his people with him — he took 600 first-quality chariots, as well as all the other chariots in Egypt, along with their commanders. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> made Pharaoh hardhearted, and he pursued the people of Isra’el, as they left boldly. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> The Egyptians went after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, with his cavalry and army, and overtook them as they were encamped by the sea, by Pi-Hachirot, in front of Ba‘al-Tz’fon. As Pharaoh approached, the people of Isra’el looked up and saw the Egyptians right there, coming after them. In great fear the people of Isra’el cried out to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and said to Moshe, “Was it because there weren’t enough graves in Egypt that you brought us out to die in the desert? Why have you done this to us, bringing us out of Egypt? Didn’t we tell you in Egypt to let us alone, we’ll just go on being slaves for the Egyptians? It would be better for us to be the Egyptians’ slaves than to die in the desert!” Moshe answered the people, “Stop being so fearful! Remain steady, and you will see how </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> is going to save you. He will do it today — today you have seen the Egyptians, but you will never see them again! </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> will do battle for you.

Tell the people of Isra’el to go forward! Lift your staff, reach out with your hand over the sea, and divide it in two. The people of Isra’el will advance into the sea on dry ground. As for me, I will make the Egyptians hardhearted; and they will march in after them; thus I will win glory for myself at the expense of Pharaoh and all his army, chariots and cavalry. Then the Egyptians will realize that I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, when I have won myself glory at the expense of Pharaoh, his chariots and his cavalry.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Next, the angel of God, who was going ahead of the camp of Isra’el, moved away and went behind them; and the column of cloud moved away from in front of them and stood behind them. It stationed itself between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Isra’el — there was cloud and darkness here, but light by night there; so that the one did not come near the other all night long.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moshe reached his hand out over the sea, and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> caused the sea to go back before a strong east wind all night. He made the sea become dry land, and its water was divided in two.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Egyptians continued their pursuit, going after them into the sea — all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and cavalry.

   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Sea Divided</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God spake to Moses, saying, &quot;Why dost thou stand here praying? My children&apos;s prayer has anticipated thine. For thee there is naught to do but lift up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it.&quot; Moses replied: &quot;Thou commandest me to divide the sea, and lay bare the dry ground in the midst of it, and yet Thou didst Thyself make it a perpetual decree, that the sand shall be placed for the bound of the sea.&quot; And again God spake to Moses: &quot;Thou has not read the beginning of the Torah. I, yea, I, did speak, &apos;Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear,&apos; and at that time I made the condition that the waters shall divide before Israel. Take the rod that I gave unto thee, and go to the sea upon Mine errand, and speak thus: &apos;I am the messenger sent by the Creator of the world! Uncover thy paths, O sea, for My children, that they may go through the midst of thee on dry ground.&apos;&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses spoke to the sea as God had bidden him, but it replied, &quot;I will not do according to thy words, for thou are only a man born of woman, and, besides, I am three days older than thou, O man, for I was brought forth on the third day of creation, and thou on the sixth.&quot; Moses lost no time, but carried back to God the words the sea has spoken, and the Lord said&quot; &quot;Moses, what does a master do with an intractable servant?&quot; &quot;He beats him with a rod,&quot; said Moses. &quot;Do thus!&quot; ordered God. &quot;Lift up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thereupon Moses raised up his rod-the rod that had been created at the very beginning of the world, on which were graven in plain letters the great and exalted Name, the names of the ten plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians, and the names of the three Fathers, the six Mothers, and the twelve tribes of Jacob. This rod he lifted up, and stretched it out over the sea.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The sea, however, continued in its perverseness, and Moses entreated God to give His command direct to it. But God refused, saying: &quot;Were I to command the sea to divide, it would never again return to its former estate. Therefore, do thou convey My order to it, that it be not drained dry forever. But I will let a semblance of My strength accompany thee, and that will compel its obedience.&quot; When the sea saw the Strength of God at the right hand of Moses, it spoke to the earth saying, &quot;Make hollow places for me, that I may hide myself therein before the Lord of all created things, blessed be He.&quot; Noticing the terror of the sea, Moses said to it: &quot;For a whole day I spoke to thee at the bidding of the Holy One, who desired thee to divide, but thou didst refuse to pay heed to my words; even when I showed thee my rod, thou didst remain obdurate. What hath happened now that thou skippest hence?&quot; The sea replied, &quot;I am fleeing, not before thee, but before the Lord of all created things, that His Name be magnified in all the earth.&quot; And the waters of the Red Sea divided, and not they alone, but all the waters in heaven and on earth, in whatever vessel it was, in cisterns, in wells, in caves, in casks, in pitchers, in drinking cups, and in glasses, and none of these waters returned to their former estate until Israel has passed through the sea on dry land.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The angel Gabriel was eager to drown the Egyptians during the same night, but God bade him wait until early the next day, until the hour of the morning watch, when Abraham had made himself ready to set out for the sacrifice of his son. Gabriel succeeded, however, in holding back the turbulent water about to sweep over Israel. To the wall of water on the right, he called, &quot;Beware of Israel, who will receive the law in time to come from the right hand of the Lord,&quot; and turning to the wall of water on the left, he said, &quot;Beware of Israel, who will wind the phylacteries about their left hand in time to come.&quot; The water behind he admonished, &quot;Beware of Israel, who will let the Zizit drop down upon their back in time to come,&quot; and to the water towering in front </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">of them, he called, &quot;Beware of Israel, who bear the sign of the covenant upon their bodies.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind, the wind He always makes use of when He chastises the nations. The same east wind had brought the deluge; it had laid the tower of Babel in ruins; it was to cause the destruction of Samaria, Jerusalem, and Tyre; and it will, in future, be the instrument for castigating Rome drunken with pleasure; and likewise the sinners in Gehenna are punished by means of the east wind. All night long God made it to blow over the sea. To prevent the enemy from inflicting harm upon the Israelites, He enveloped the Egyptians in profound darkness, so impenetrable it could be felt, and none could move or change his posture. He that sat when it fell could not arise from his place, and he that stood could not sit down. Nevertheless, the Egyptians could see that the Israelites were surrounded by bright light, and were enjoying a banquet where they stood, and when they tried to speed darts and arrows against them, the missiles were caught up by the cloud and by the angels hovering between the two camps, and no harm came to Israel.</text:span></text:p>

The Egyptians tried to flee, but </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> swept them into the sea. The water came back and covered all the chariots and cavalry of Pharaoh’s army who had followed them into the sea — not even one of them was left. But the people of Isra’el walked on dry ground in the sea, with the water walled up for them on their right and on their left.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Passage Through The Red Sea</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">On the morning after the eventful night, though the sea was not yet made dry land, the Israelites, full of trust in God, were ready to cast themselves into its waters. The tribes contended with one another for the honor of being the first to jump. Without awaiting the outcome of the wordy strife, the tribe of Benjamin sprang in, and the princes of Judah were so incensed at having been deprived of pre-eminence in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">danger that they pelted the Benjamites with stones. God knew that the Judaeans and the Benjamites were animated by a praiseworthy purpose. The ones like the others desired but to magnify the Name of God, and He rewarded both tribes: in Benjamin&apos;s allotment the Shekinah took up her residence, and the royalty of Israel was conferred upon Judah.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When God saw the two tribes in the waves of the sea, He called upon Moses, and said: &quot;My beloved are in danger of drowning, and thou standest by and prayest. Bid Israel go forward, and thou lift up thy rod over the sea, and divide it.&quot; Thus it happened, and Israel passed through the sea with its water cleft in twain.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The dividing of the sea was but the first of ten miracles connected with the passage of the Israelites through it. The others were that the waters united in a vault above their heads; twelve paths opened up, one for each of the tribes; the water became transparent as glass, and each tribe could see the others; the soil underfoot was dry, but it changed into clay when the Egyptians stepped upon it; the walls of water transformed into rocks, against which the Egyptians were thrown and dashed to death, while before the Israelites could slake their thirst; and, finally, the tenth wonder was, that this drinking water was congealed in the heart of the sea as soon as they had satisfied their need.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">And there were other miracles, besides. The sea yielded the Israelites whatever their hearts desired. If a child cried as it lay in the arms of its mother, she needed but to stretch out her hand and pluck and apple or some fruit and quiet it. The waters were piled up to the height of sixteen hundred miles, and they could be seen by all the nations of the earth.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The great wonder of Israel&apos;s passage through the sea took place in the presence of the three Fathers and the six Mothers, for God had fetched them out of their graves to the shores of the Red Sea, to be witnesses of the marvelous deeds wrought in behalf of their children.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Wonderful as were the miracles connected with the rescue of the Israelites from the waters of the sea, those performed when the Egyptians were drowned were no less remarkable. First of all God felt called upon to defend Israel&apos;s cause before Uzza, the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Angel of the Egyptians, who would not allow his people to perish in the waters of the sea. He appeared on the spot at the very moment when God wanted to drown the Egyptians, and he spake: &quot;O Lord of the world! Thou are called just and upright, and before Thee there is no wrong, no forgetting, no respecting of persons. Why, then, dost Thou desire to make my children perish in the sea? Canst Thou say that my children drowned or slew a single one of Thine? If it be on account of the rigorous slavery that my children imposed upon Israel, then consider that Thy children have received their wages, in that they took their silver and golden vessels from them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then God convoked all the members of His celestial family, and He spake to the angel hosts: &quot;Judge ye in truth between Me and yonder Uzza, the Angel of the Egyptians. At the first I brought a famine upon his people, and I appointed My friend Joseph over them, who saved them through his sagacity, and they all became his slaves. Then My children went down into their land as strangers, in consequence of the famine, and they made the children of Israel to serve with rigor in all manner of hard work there is in the world. They groaned on account of their bitter service, and their cry rose up to Me, and I sent Moses and Aaron, My faithful messengers, to Pharaoh. When they came before the king of Egypt, they spake to him, &apos;Thus said the Lord, the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.&apos; In the presence of the kings of the East and of the West, the sinner began to boast, saying: &apos;Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto His voice, to let Israel go? Why comes He not before me, like all the kings of the world, and why doth He not bring me a present like the others? This God of whom you speak, I know Him not at all. Wait and let me search my lists, and see whether I can find His Name.&apos; But his servants said, &apos;We have heard that He is the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.&apos; Then Pharaoh asked My messengers, &apos;What are the works of this God?&apos; and they replied, &apos;He is the God of gods, the Lord of lords, who created the heaven and the earth.&apos; But Pharaoh doubted their words, and said, &apos;There is no God in all the world that can accomplish such works besides me, for I made myself, and I made the Nile river.&apos; Because he denied Me thus, I sent ten plagues upon him, and he was compelled to let My children go. Yet, in spite of all, he did not leave off from his wicked ways, and he tried to bring them back under his bondage. Now, seeing all that </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">hath happened to him, and that he will not acknowledge Me as God and Lord, does he not deserve to be drowned in the sea with his host?&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Celestial family called out when the Lord had ended His defense, &quot;Thou hast every right to drown him in the sea!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Uzza heard their verdict, and he said: &quot;O Lord of all the worlds! I know that my people deserve the punishment Thou has decreed, but may it please Thee to deal with them according to Thy attribute of mercy, and take pity upon the work of Thy hands, for Thy tender mercies are over all Thy works!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Almost the Lord had yielded to Uzza&apos;s entreaties, when Michael gave a sign to Gabriel that mad him fly to Egypt swiftly and fetch thence a brick for which a Hebrew child had been used as a mortar. Holding this incriminating object in his had, Gabriel stepped into the presence of God, and said: &quot;O Lord of the world! Wilt Thou have compassion with the accursed nation that has slaughtered Thy children so cruelly?&quot; Then the Lord turned Himself away from His attribute of mercy, and seating Himself upon His throne of justice He resolved to drown the Egyptians in the sea.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The first upon whom judgement was executed was the Angel of Egypt-Uzza was thrown into the sea. A similar fate overtook Rahab, the Angel of the Sea, with his hosts. Rahab had made intercession before God in behalf of the Egyptians. He had said: &quot;Why shouldst Thou drown the Egyptians? Let is suffice the Israelites that Thou hast saved them out of the hand of their masters.&quot; At that God dealt Rahab and his army a blow, under which they staggered and fell dead, and then He cast their corpses in the sea, whence its unpleasant odor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Destruction Of The Egyptians</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At the moment when the last of the Israelites stepped out of the bed of the sea, the first of the Egyptians set foot into it, but in the same instant the waters surged back into their wonted place, and all the Egyptians perished.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But drowning was not the only punishment decreed upon them by God. He undertook a thoroughgoing campaign against them. When Pharaoh was preparing to persecute the Israelites, he asked his army which of the saddle beasts was the swiftest runner, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">that one he would use, and they said: &quot;There is none swifter than thy piebald mare, whose like is to be found nowhere in the world.&quot; Accordingly, Pharaoh mounted the mare, and pursued after the Israelites seaward. And while Pharaoh was inquiring of his army as to the swiftest animal to mount, God was questioning the angels as to the swiftest creature to use to the detriment of Pharaoh. And the angels answered: &quot;O Lord of the world! All thing are Thine, and all are Thine handiwork. Thou knowest well, and it is manifest before Thee, that among all Thy creatures there is none so quick as the wind that comes from under the throne of Thy glory,&quot; and the Lord flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The angels now advanced to support the Lord in His war against the Egyptians. Some brought swords, some arrows, and some spears. But God warded them off, saying, &quot;Away! I need no help!&quot; The arrows sped by Pharaoh against the children of Israel were answered by the Lord with fiery darts directed against the Egyptians. Pharaoh&apos;s army advanced with gleaming swords, and the Lord sent out lightnings that discomfited the Egyptians. Pharaoh hurled missiles, and the Lord discharged hailstones and coals of fire against him. With trumpets, sackbuts, and horns the Egyptians made their assault, and the Lord thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice. In vain the Egyptians marched forward in orderly battle array; the Lord deprived them of their standards, and they were thrown into wild confusion. To lure them into the water, the Lord caused fiery steeds to swim out upon the sea, and the horses of the Egyptians followed them, each with a rider upon his back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now the Egyptians tried to flee to their land in their chariots drawn by she-mules. As they had treated the children of Israel in a way contrary to nature, so the Lord treated them now. Not the she-mules pulled the chariots but the chariots, though fire from heaven had consumed their wheels, dragged the men and the beasts into the water. The chariots were laden with silver, gold, and all sorts of costly things, which the river Pishon, as it flows forth from Paradise, carries down into the Gihon. Thence the treasures float into the Red Sea, and by its waters they were tossed into the chariots of the Egyptians. It was the wish of Israel, and for this reason He caused the chariots to roll down into the sea, and the sea in turn to cast them out upon the opposite shore, at the feet of the Israelites.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">And the Lord fought against the Egyptians also with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. The former made the soil miry, and the mire was heated to the boiling point by the latter, so that the hoofs of the horses dropped from their feet, and they could not budge from the spot.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The anguish and the torture that God brought upon the Egyptians at the Red Sea caused them by far more excruciating pain than the plagues they had endured in Egypt, for at the sea He delivered them into the hands of the Angels of Destruction, who tormented them pitilessly. Had God not endowed the Egyptians with a double portion of strength, they could not have stood the pain a single moment.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The last judgement executed upon the Egyptians corresponded to the wicked designs harbored against Israel by the three different parties among them when they set out in pursuit of their liberated slaves. The first party had said, &quot;We will bring Israel back to Egypt;&quot; the second had said, &quot;We will strip them bare,&quot; and the third had said, &quot;We will slay them all.&quot; The Lord blew upon the first with His breath, and the sea covered them; the second party He shook into the sea, and the third He pitched into the depths of the abyss. He tossed them about as lentils are shaken up and down in a saucepan; the upper ones are made to fall to the bottom, the lower ones fly to the top. This was the experience of the Egyptians. And worse still, first the rider and his beast were whisked high up in the air, and then the two together, the rider sitting upon the back of the beast, were hurled to the bottom of the sea.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The Egyptians </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T17">e</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">ndeavored to save themselves from the sea by conjuring charms, for they were great magicians. Of the ten measures of magic allotted to the world, they had taken nine for themselves. And, indeed, they succeeded for the moment; they escaped out of the sea. But immediately the sea said to itself, &quot;How can I allow the pledge entrusted to me by God to be taken from me?&quot; And the water rushed after the Egyptians, and dragged back every man of them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Among the Egyptians were the two arch-magicians Jannes and Jambres. They made wings for themselves, with which they flew up to heaven. They also said to Pharaoh: &quot;If God Himself hath done this thing, we can effect naught. But if this work has been put into the hands of His angel, then we will shake his lieutenants into the sea.&quot; They proceeded at once to use their magic contrivances, whereby they dragged the angels </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">down. These cried up to God: &quot;Save us, O God, for the waters are come in unto our soul! Speak Thy word that will cause the magicians to drown in the mighty waters.&quot; And Gabriel cried to God, &quot;By the greatness of Thy glory dash Thy adversaries to pieces.&quot; Hereupon God bade Michael go and execute judgement upon the two magicians. The archangel seized hold of Jannes and Jambres by the locks of their hair, and he shattered them against the surface of the water.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thus all the Egyptians were drowned. Only one was spared-Pharaoh himself. When the children of Israel raised their voices to sing a song of praise to God at the shores of the Red Sea, Pharaoh heard it as he was jostled hither and thither by the billows, and he pointed his finger heavenward, and called out: &quot;I believe in Thee, O God! Thou art righteous, and I and My people are wicked, and I acknowledge now that there is no god in the world beside Thee.&quot; Without a moments delay, Gabriel descended and laid and iron chain about Pharaoh&apos;s neck, and holding him securely, he addressed him thus: &quot;Villain! Yesterday thou didst say, &apos;Who is the Lord that I should hearken to His voice?&apos; and now thou sayest, &apos;The Lord is righteous.&apos;&quot; With that he let him drop into the depths of the sea, and there he tortured him for fifty days, to make the power of God known to him. At the end of the time he installed him as king of the great city of Nineveh, and after the lapse of many centuries, when Jonah came to Nineveh, and prophesied the overthrow of the city on account of the evil done by the people, it was Pharaoh who, seized by fear and terror, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes, and with his own mouth made proclamation and published this decree through Nineveh: &quot;Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed nor drink water; for I know there is no god beside Him in all the world, all His words are truth, and all His judgements are true and faithful.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Pharaoh never died, and never will die. He always stands at the portal of hell, and when the kings of the nations enter, he makes the power of God known to them at once, in these words: &quot;O ye fools! Why have ye not learnt knowledge from me? I am denied the Lord God, and He brought ten plagues upon me, sent me to the bottom of the sea, kept me there for fifty days, released me then, and brought me up. Thus I could not but believe in Him.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">God caused the Egyptians to be washed ashore in their death struggle. There were four reasons for this. The Israelites were not to say that as they themselves had escaped, so also the Egyptians had passed through the sea dryshod, only the latter had gone in another direction, and therefore had vanished from sight. The Egyptians, on the other hand, were not to think that the children of Israel had been drowned in the sea like themselves. In the third place, the Israelites were to have, as their booty, the silver, gold, and other precious things with which the Egyptians were decked; and, finally, the Israelites were to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing their enemies suffer. With their finger thy could point them out one by one, saying, &quot;This one way my taskmaster, who beat me with those fists of his at which the dogs are now gnawing, and yonder Egyptian, the dogs are chewing the feet with which he kicked me.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As they lay on the shore in their last agony, they had to witness their own destruction and the victory of the Israelites, and they also beheld the suffering of their brethren that had remained behind in Egypt, for God poured out His punishment over the whole people, whether in Egypt or at the Red Sea. As for the corpses by the shores of the sea, they did not remain unburied, the earth swallowed them, by way of reward for Pharaoh&apos;s having acknowledged the justice of the chastisement that had been inflicted upon king and people. Before their corpses had been disposed of in this way, there had been a quarrel between the earth and the sea. The sea said to the earth, &quot;Take thy children unto thyself,&quot; and the earth retorted, &quot;Keep those whom thou hast slain.&quot; The sea hesitated to do as the earth bade, for fear that God would demand them back on the day of judgement; and the earth hesitated, because it remembered with terror the curse that had been pronounced upon it for having sucked up Abel&apos;s blood. Only after God swore and oath, not to punish it for receiving the corpses of the Egyptians, would the earth swallow them.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Mighty is faith, for the spirit of God came upon the Israelites as a reward for their trust in God, and in His servant Moses; and it was in this exaltation that they sang to the Lord a song that moved Him to grant forgiveness for all their sins. This song was the second of the nine songs that in the course of history of Israel sang to their God. They assembled to sing the first in Egypt, on the night when they were freed from captivity; their second was the song of triumph by the Red Sea; their third, when the well sprang up in the wilderness; Moses sang the fourth before his death; the fifth was Joshua&apos;s song after his victory over the five Amorite Kings; Deborah and Barak sang the sixth when they conquered Sisera; the seventh was David&apos;s psalm of thanksgiving to God for his deliverance out of the hand of all his enemies; the eighth was Solomon&apos;s song at the dedication of the Temple; the ninth Jehoshaphat sang as, trusting in God, he went to battle against the Moabites and the Ammonites. The tenth and last song, however, will be that grand and mighty song, when Israel will raise their voice in triumph at their future deliverance, for that will be the final release of Israel for all time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Israel prepared to sound their praises to God for delivering them from destruction in the Red Sea, God, to show His recognition of Israel&apos;s fulfillment of the token of the Abrahamic covenant, bade the angels who came to intone their song, wait: &quot;Let My children sing first,&quot; He said. This incident with the angels is like the story of the king who, upon returning from a victorious campaign, was told that his son and his servant were waiting with wreaths in their hands, and were asking who should first crown him. The king said, &quot;O ye fools, to question if my servant should walk before my son! No, let my son come first!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">This was the second time the angels were obliged to retire before Israel. When Israel stood by the Red Sea, before them the rolling waters, and behind them the hosts of Egypt, then, too, the angels appeared, to sing their daily song of praise to the Lord, but God called to them, &quot;Forbear! My children are in distress, and you would sing!&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">But even after the men had completed their song, it was not yet given to the angels to raise their voices, for after the men followed the women of Israel, and only then came the turn of the angels. Then they began to murmur, and said, &quot;Is it not enough that the men have preceded us? Shall the women come before us also?&quot; But God replied, &quot;As surely as ye live, so it is.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At first Israel requested their leader Moses to begin the song, but he declined, saying, &quot;No, ye shall begin it, for it is a greater mark of honor to be praised by the multitude than by a single one.&quot; At once the people sang: &quot;We will glorify the Eternal, for He has shown us signs and tokens. When the Egyptians passed the decree against us, and said, &apos;Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river,&apos; our mothers went into the field, and Thou didst bid a sleep to fall upon them, and they bore us without any pain; and the angels descended from Heaven, washed and anointed us, and robed us in many-colored silken garments, and placed in our hands two lumps, one of butter and one of honey. When our mothers awoke and saw us washed, anointed, and clothed in silk, then they praised Thee, and said, &apos;Praise be God who has not turned His grace and His lasting love from the seed of our father Abraham; and now behold! they are in Thy hand, do with them as Thou wilt.&apos; And they departed. When the Egyptians saw us, they approached to kill us, but Thou in Thy great mercy didst bid the earth swallow us and set us in another place, where we were not seen by the Egyptians, and lo! in this way didst Thou save us from their hand. When we grew up, we wandered in troops to Egypt, where each recognized his parents and his family. All this hast Thou done for us, therefore will we sing of Thee.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thereupon Moses said: &quot;Ye have given thanks to the Holy One, blessed be He, and not I will praise His name, for to me also has He shown signs and tokens. The Lord is my strength and my song, and He is become my salvation; He is my God, and I will prepare Him and habitation; my father&apos;s God, and I will exalt Him.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The song by the Red Sea was as much the song of Moses as of all Israel, for the great leader counted as not less than all the other Israelites together, and, besides, he had composed a large portion of the song. In virtue of the spirit of God that possessed them while they sang, Moses and the people mutually supplemented each other, so that, as soon as Moses spoke half the verse, the people repeated it, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">and linked the second complementary part to it. So Moses began with the half verse, &quot;I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously,&quot; whereupon the people answered, &quot;The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.&quot; And in this wise developed the whole song.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But not alone the adults took part in this song, even the sucklings dropped their mothers&apos; breasts to join in singing; yea, even the embryos in the womb joined the melody, and the angels&apos; voices swelled the song. God so distinguished Israel during the passage through the Red Sea, that even the children beheld His glory, yea, even the woman slave saw more of the presence of God by the Red Sea than the Prophet Ezekiel was ever permitted to behold.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">They closed the song with the words: &quot;Let us set the crown of glory upon the head of our Deliverer, who suffers all things to perish, but does not Himself decay, who changes all things, but is Himself unchanged. His is the diadem of sovereignty, for He is the King of kings in this world, and His is the sovereignty of the world to come; it is His and will be His in all eternity.&quot; Thereupon Moses spake to Israel, &quot;Ye have seen all the signs, all miracles and works of glory that the Holy One, blessed be He, hath wrought for you, but even more will He do for you in the world to come; for not like unto this world is the world of the hereafter; for in this world war and suffering, evil inclination, Satan, and the Angel of Death hold sway; but in the future would, there will be neither suffering nor enmity, neither Satan nor the Angel of Death, neither groans nor oppression, nor evil inclination.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As Moses and the race that wandered from Egypt with him sang a song to the Lord by the Red Sea, so shall they sing again in the world to come. In the world to come, all generations will pass before the Lord and will ask Him who should first intone the song of praise, whereupon He will reply: &quot;In the past it was the generation of Moses that offered up to me a song of praise. Let them do it now once more, and as Moses conducted the song by the Red Sea, so shall he do in the world of the hereafter.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In other respects, too, it shall be in the world to come as it was at the time of the song by the sea. For when Israel intoned the song of praise, God put on a festive robe, on which were embroidered all the promises for a happy future to Israel. Among them were written: &quot;Then shall thy light break forth as the morning&quot;; &quot;Then </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">said they among the heathen. &apos;The Lord hath done great things for them,&apos;&quot; and many similar promises. But when Israel sinned, God rent the festive robe, and He will not restore it, or put it on until the coming of the future world.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">After the men had completed the song, the women under the guidance of Miriam sang the same song to the accompaniment of music and dancing. The Israelites had had perfect faith, that God would perform for them miracles and deeds of glory, hence they had provided themselves with timbrels and with flutes, that they might have them at hand to glorify the anticipated miracles. Then Miriam said to the women, &quot;Let us sing unto the Lord, for strength and sublimity are His; He lords it over the lordly, and He resents presumption. He hurled Pharaoh&apos;s horses and chariots into the sea, and drowned them, because wicked Pharaoh in his presumption pursued God&apos;s people, Israel.&quot;</text:span></text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Awful Desert</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">Just as Israel had displayed sullenness and lack of faith upon approaching the sea, so did they upon leaving it. Hardly had they seen that the Egyptians met death in the waters of the sea, when they spoke to Moses, and said: &quot;God had led us from Egypt only to grant us five tokens: To give us the wealth of Egypt, to let us walk in clouds of glory, to cleave the sea for us, to take vengeance on the Egyptians, and to let us sing Him a song of praise. Now that all this has taken place, let us return to Egypt.&quot; Moses answered: &quot;The Eternal said, &apos;The Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, yes shall see them again no more forever.&apos;&quot; But the people were not yet content, and said, &quot;Now the Egyptians are all dead, and therefore we can return to Egypt.&quot; Then Moses said, &quot;You must now redeem your pledge, for God said, &apos;When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.&apos;&quot; Still the people remained headstrong, and without giving heed to Moses, they set out on the road to Egypt, under the guidance of an idol that they had brought with them out of Egypt, and had even retained during their passage through the sea. Only through sheer force was Moses able to restrain them from their sinful transgression. This was the second of the ten temptations with which Israel tempted God during their wanderings through the desert.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">There was one other difficulty with the people that Moses had to overcome: The sea cast up many jewels, pearls and other treasures that had belonged to the Egyptians, drowned in its waves, and Israel found it hard to tear themselves away from the spot that brought them such riches. Moses, however, said, &quot;Do you really believe that the sea will continue to yield you pearls and jewels?&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">From the sea they passed to the desert Shur, a horrible and dreadful wilderness, full of snakes, lizards, and scorpions, extending over hundreds of miles. So deadly is the nature of the snakes that dwell in the desert, that if one of them merely glides over the shadow of a flying bird, the bird falls into pieces. It was in this desert that the following happened to King Shapor: A cohort that he sent through this desert was swallowed by a snake, and the same fate overtook a second and a third cohort. Upon <text:soft-page-break/>the advice of his sages, he then filled the hides of animals with hot coals wrapped in straw, and had these cast before the snake until it expired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">It was then a proof of Israel&apos;s great faith in their God, that they obeyed Moses, and without murmur or delay followed him into this frightful wilderness. Therefore did God reward them for their trust in Him, for not only were they not harmed by the snakes and scorpions during their many years stay in the desert, but they were even relieved of the fear of the reptiles, for as soon as the snakes saw the Israelites, they meekly lay down upon the sand. For three days they marched through the desert, uncomplaining, but when their supply of water gave out, the people murmured against Moses, saying, &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; While crossing through the Red Sea they had provided themselves with water, for, miraculously, the sea flowed sweet for them; and now when the supply was becoming exhausted, they began to give expression to their dissatisfaction. On this occasion they again betrayed their faintheartedness, for instead of seeking advice from their leader Moses, they began to murmur against him and against God, even though at present they had not yet suffered from lack of water. So poorly did they stand the test to which God has put them, for in fact the very ground upon which they trod had running water beneath it, but they were not aware of this. God had desired to see how they would act under these conditions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The people were all the more exasperated because their joy, when they sighted the springs and hastened to draw from the, turned to keenest disappointment when they tasted of the water and found it bitter. These deluded hopes cast them down spiritually as well as physically, and grieved them, not so much for their own sakes as for those of their young children, to whose pleas for water they could not listen without tears. Some of the thoughtless and fickle of faith among them uttered the accusation that even the former kindness had been granted them so much as a benefit, but rather with a view to the present and much greater privation. These said that death by the hand of the enemy is to be thrice preferred to perishing by thirst; for by the wise man, speedy and painless departure from life is in no way to be distinguished from immortality; the only real death, however, is slow and painful dying, for the dread lies not in being dead, but in dying.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:soft-page-break/>While they indulged in these lamentations, Moses prayed to God to forgive the faint of heart their unseemly words, and, furthermore, to supply the general want. Mindful of the distress of the people, Moses did not pray long, but uttered his request in a few words; and quickly, as he had prayed, was his prayer answered. God bade him take a piece of a laurel tree, write upon it the great and glorious name of God, and throw it into the water, whereupon the water would become drinkable and sweet.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, differ from the ways of man: Man turns bitter to sweet by the agency of some sweet stuff, but God transformed the bitter water through the bitter laurel tree. When Israel beheld this miracle, they asked forgiveness of their heavenly Father, and said: &quot;O Lord of the world! We sinned against Thee when we murmured about the water.&quot; Not through this miracle alone, however, has Marah become a significant spot for Israel, but, especially, because there God gave to Israel important percepts, like the Sabbath rest, marriage and civil laws, and said to the people: &quot;If you will observe these statutes, you will receive many more, the Ten Commandments, the Halakot, and the Haggadot; the Torah, however, will bring you happiness and life. If you will diligently endeavor to walk through life uprightly, so that you will be virtuous in your dealing with men, I will value it as if you had fulfilled all commandments, and will put upon you none of those diseases that I brought Egypt. If, however, you will not be mindful of My laws, and will be visited by diseases, then will I be you physician and will make you well, for as soon as you will observe the laws, shall the diseases vanish.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The cause for the want of water at Marah had been that for three days the people had neglected the study of the Torah, and it was for this reason that the prophets and elders of Israel instituted the custom of reading from the Torah on Saturday, Monday and Thursday, at the public service, so that three days might never again pass without a reading from the Torah.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">From Marah they moved on to Elim. From a distance palm trees made the place look inviting enough, but when the people came close, they were again disappointed; there were not more than three score and ten palm tress, and there were of stunted growth owing to a lack of water, for in spite of the presence of twelve wells of water, the soil was so barren and sandy that the wells were not sufficient to water it. Here <text:soft-page-break/>again the marvelous intercession of God in favor of the fate of Israel is shown, for the scant supply of water at Elim, which had hardly sufficed for seventy palm trees, satisfied sixty myriads of the wandering people that stayed there for several days.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The men of understanding could at this place see a clear allusion to the fortune of the people; for there are twelve tribes of the people, each of which, if it prove God-fearing, will be a well of water, inasmuch as its piety will constantly and continually bring forth beautiful deeds; the leaders of the people, however, are seventy, and they recall the noble palm tree, for in outward appearance as well as in its fruits, it is the most beautiful of trees, whose seat of life does not lie buried deep in the roots, as with other plants, but soars high, set like the heart in the midst of its branches, by which it is surrounded as a queen under the protection of her bodyguard. The soul of him who has tasted piety possesses a similar spirit; it has learned to look up and ascend, and itself ever busy with spiritual things and the investigation of Divine beauty, disdains earthly things, and considers them only a childish play, whereas that aspiration alone seems serious.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">It was at Elim, where, at the creation of the world, God had made the twelve wells of water, and the seventy palm trees, to correspond to the twelve tribes and the seventy elders of Israel, that Israel first took up the study of the law, for there they studied the laws given them at Marah.</text:p>

They went out into the Shur Desert; but after traveling three days in the desert, they had found no water. They arrived at Marah but couldn’t drink the water there, because it was bitter. This is why they called it Marah [bitterness]. The people grumbled against Moshe and asked, “What are we to drink?” Moshe cried to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">; and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> showed him a certain piece of wood, which, when he threw it into the water, made the water taste good.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The bread which Israel had taken along out of Egypt sufficed for thirty-one days, and when they had consumed it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">murmured against their leader Moses. It was not only immediate want that oppressed them, but despair of a food supply for the future; for when they saw the vast, extensive, utterly barren wilderness before them, their courage gave way, and they said: &quot;We migrated, expecting freedom, and now we are not even free from the cares of subsistence; we are not, as out leader promised, the happiest, but in truth the most unfortunate of men. After our leader&apos;s words had keyed us to the highest pitch of expectation, and had filled out ears with vain hopes, he tortures us with famine and does not provide even the necessary food. With the name of a new settlement he has deceived this great multitude; after he had succeeded in leading us from a well-known to an uninhabited land, he now plans to send us to the underworld, the last road of life. &apos;Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord during the three days of darkness in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.&apos;&quot; In their exasperation they spoke untruths, for in reality they had suffered from want of food in Egypt, too, as the Egyptians had not given them enough to eat.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In spite of the railings against him, Moses was not so much indignant about their words as about the fickleness of the people. After those many quite extraordinary experiences they had no right to expect merely the natural and the probable, but should cheerfully have trusted him; for, truly, in the sight of all, they had been shown the most tangible proofs of his reliability. When, on the other hand, Moses considered their distress, he forgave them; for he told himself that a multitude is by nature fickle, and allows itself to be easily influenced by impressions of the moment, which cast the past into oblivion, and engender despair of the future.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God also forgave the unworthy conduct of Israel, and instead of being angry with them because they murmured against Him, when it should have been their duty to pray to Him, He was ready to grant them aid, saying to Moses, &quot;They act according to their lights, and I will act according to Mine; not later than to-morrow morning manna will descend from heaven.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15"/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">As a reward for Abraham&apos;s readiness, in answer to the summons to sacrifice Isaac, when he said, &quot;Here am I,&quot; God promised manna to the descendants of Abraham with </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">the same words, &quot;Here I am.&quot; In the same way, during their wanderings through the wilderness, God repaid the descendants of Abraham for what their ancestor had done by the angels who visited him. He himself had fetched bread for them, and likewise God Himself caused bread to rain from heaven; he himself ran before them on their way, and likewise God moved before Israel; he had water fetched for them, and likewise God, through Moses, caused water to flow from the rock; he bade them seek shade under the tree, and likewise God had a cloud spread over Israel. Then God spoke to Moses: &quot;I will immediately reveal Myself without Jacob, &apos;I will rain bread from My treasure in heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day.&apos;&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">There were good reasons for not exceeding a day&apos;s ration in the daily downpour of manna. First, that they might be spared the need of carrying it on their wanderings; secondly, that they might daily receive it hot; and, lastly, that they might day by day depend upon God&apos;s aid, and in this way exercise themselves in faith.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">While the people were still abed, God fulfilled their desire, and rained down manna for them. For this food had been created on the second day of creation, and ground by the angels, it later descended for the wanderers in the wilderness. The mills are stationed in the third heaven, where manna is constantly being ground for the future use of the pious; for in the future world manna will be set before them. Manna deserves its name, &quot;bread of the angels,&quot; not only because it is prepared by them, but because those who partake of it become equal to the angels in strength, and, furthermore, like them, have no need of easing themselves, as manna is entirely dissolved in the body. Not until they sinned, did they have to ease themselves like ordinary mortals.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Manna also showed its heavenly origin in the miraculous flavor it possessed. There was no need of cooking or baking it, nor did it require any other preparation, and still it contained the flavor of every conceivable dish. One had only to desire a certain dish, and no sooner had he thought of it, than manna had the flavor of the dish desire. The same food had a different taste to every one who partook of it, according to his age; to the little children it tasted like milk, to the strong youths like bread, to the old men like honey, to the sick like barley steeped in oil and honey.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">As miraculous as the taste of manna was it descent from heaven. First came a north wind to sweep the floor of the desert; then a rain to wash it quite clean; then dew descended upon it, which was congealed into a solid substance by the wind, that it might serve as a table for the heaven-descending gold. But, that no insects or vermin might settle on the manna, the frozen dew formed not only a tablecloth, but also a cover for the manna, so that it lay enclosed there as in a casket, protected from soiling or pollution above and below.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - The Gathering Of The Manna</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">With an easy mind every individual might perform his morning prayer in his house and recite the Shema&apos;, then betake himself to the entrance of his tent, and gather manna for himself and all his family. The gathering of manna caused little trouble, and those among the people who were too lazy to perform even the slightest work, went out while manna fell, so that it fell straight into their hands. The manna lasted until the fourth hour of the day, when it melted; but even the melted manna was not wasted, for out of it formed the rivers, from which the pious will drink in the hereafter. The heathen even then attempted to drink out of these streams, but the manna that tasted so deliciously to the Jews, had a quite bitter taste in the mouth of the heathen. Only indirectly could they partake of the enjoyment of manna: They used to catch the animals that drank the melted manna, and even it this form it was so delicious that the heathen cried, &quot;Happy is the people that is in such a case.&quot; For the descent of manna was not a secret to the heathen, as it settled at such enormous heights that the kings of the East and of the West could see how Israel received its miraculous food.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The mass of the manna was in proportion to its height, for as much descended day by day, as might have satisfied the wants of sixty myriads of people, through two thousand years. Such profusion of manna fell over the body of Joshua alone, as might have sufficed for the maintenance of the whole congregation. Manna, indeed, had the peculiarity of falling to every individual in the same measure; and when, after gathering, they measured it, they found that there was an omer for every man.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15"/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Many lawsuits were amicably decided through the fall of manna. If a married couple came before Moses, each accusing the other of inconstancy, Moses would say to them, &quot;To-morrow morning judgement will be given.&quot; If, then, manna descended for the wife before the house of her husband, it was known that he was in the right; but if her share descended before the house of her own parents, she was in the right.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The only days on which manna did not descend were the Sabbaths and the holy days, but then a double portion fell on the preceding day. These days had the further distinction that, while they lasted, the color of the manna sparkled more than usual, and it tasted better than usual. The people, however, were fainthearted, and on the very first Sabbath, they wanted to go out as usual to gather manna in the morning, although announcement had been made that God would send them no food on that day. Moses, however, restrained them. They attempted to do it again toward evening, and again Moses restrained them with the words, &quot;To-day ye shall not find it in the field.&quot; At these words they were greatly alarmed, for they feared that they might not receive it any more at all, but their leader quieted them with the words, &quot;To-day ye shall not find any of it, but assuredly to-morrow; in this world ye shall not receive manna on the Sabbath, but assuredly in the future world.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The unbelieving among them did not hearken to the words of God, and went out on the Sabbath to find manna. Here-upon God said to Moses: &quot;Announce these words to Israel: I have led you out of Egypt, have cleft the sea for you, have sent you manna, have caused the well of water to spring up for you, have sent the quails to come up to you, have battled for you against Amalek, and wrought other miracles for you, and still you do not obey My statutes and commandments. You have not even the excuse that I imposed full many commandments upon you, for all that I bade you do at Marah, was to observe the Sabbath, but you have violated it.&quot; &quot;If,&quot; continues Moses, &quot;you will observe the Sabbath, God will give you three festivals in the months of Nisan, Siwan, and Tishri; and as a reward for the observance of the Sabbath, you will receive six gifts from God: the land of Israel, the future world, the new world, the sovereignty of the dynasty of David, the institution of the priests and the Levites; and, furthermore, as a reward for the observance of the Sabbath, you shall be freed from the three great afflictions: from the sufferings of the times of Gog and Magog, from the travails of the Messianic time, and from the day of the great Judgement.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Israel heard these exhortations and promises, they determined to observe the Sabbath, and did so. They did not know, to be sure, what they had lost through their violation of the first Sabbath. Had Israel then observed the Sabbath, no nation would ever have been able to exercise any authority over them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">This, moreover, was not the only sin that Israel committed during this time, for some among them also broke the other commandment in regard to manna, that it, not to store it away from day to day. These sinners were none other than the infamous pair, Dathan and Abiram, who did not hearken to the word of God, but saved the manna for the following day. But if they fancied they could conceal their sinful deed, they were mistaken, for great swarms of worms bred from the manna, and these moved in a long train from their tents to the other tents, so that everyone perceived what these two had done.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">To serve future generations as a tangible proof of the infinite power of God, the Lord bade Moses lay an earthen vessel full of manna before the Holy Ark, and this command was carried out by Aaron in the second year of the wanderings through the desert. When, many centuries later, the prophet Jeremiah exhorted his contemporaries to study the Torah, and they answered his exhortations, saying, &quot;How shall we then maintain ourselves?&quot; the prophet brought forth the vessel with manna, and spoke to them, saying: &quot;O generation, see ye the word of the Lord; see what it was that served your fathers as food when they applied themselves to the study of the Torah. You, too, will God support in the same way, if you will but devote yourselves to the study of the Torah.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15"/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When the imminent destruction of the Temple was announced to King Josiah, he concealed the Holy Ark, and with it also the vessel with manna, as well as the jug filled with sacred oil, which was used by Moses for anointing the sacred implements, and other sacred objects. In the Messianic time the prophet Elijah will restore all these concealed objects.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Israel received three gifts during their wanderings through the desert: the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna; the first for the merits of Miriam, the second for </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">those of Aaron, and the third for those of Moses. When Miriam died, the well disappeared for a time, but it reappeared as a reward for the merits of Aaron and Moses; when Aaron dies, the clouds of glory disappeared for a time, but reappeared owing to the merits of Moses. But when the last-named died, the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna disappeared forever. Throughout forty years, however, manna served them not only as food, but also as provender for their cattle, for the dew that preceded the fall of manna during the night brought grain for their cattle. Manna also replaced perfume for them, for it shed and excellent fragrance upon those who ate of it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In spite of all the excellent qualities of manna, they were not satisfied with it, and demanded that Moses and Aaron give them flesh to eat. These replied: &quot;We might put up with you if you murmured only against us, but you murmur against the Eternal. Come forward, that you may hear the judgment of God.&quot; At once God appeared to Moses, and said to him: &quot;It is revealed to Me what the congregation of Israel have said, and what they will say, but tell them this: You have demanded two things; you have desired bread, and I gave it to you, because man cannot exist without it; but now, filled to satiety, you demand flesh; this also will I give you, so that you might not say if your wish were denied. &apos;God cannot grant it,&apos; but at some future time you shall make atonement for it; I am a judge and shall assign punishment for this.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In the meantime, however, God granted their wish, and toward evening thick swarms of quails came up from the sea, and covered the whole camp, taking their flight quite low, not two ells above the ground, so that they might be easily caught. Contrary to the manna, which fell in the morning, the quails did not come before evenfall; with a radiant countenance God gave them the former, as their desire for bread was justified, but with a darkened mien, under cover of night, He sent quails. Now, because the one food came in the morning and the second in the evening, Moses instituted the custom among his people of taking two meals a day, one in the morning and one in the evening; and he set the meal with the use of meat for the evening. At the same time he taught them the prayer in which they were to offer thanks after eating manna, which read: &quot;Blessed be Thou, O God our Lord, King of the world, who in Thy bounty, dost provide for all the world; who, in Thy grace, goodwill, and mercy, dost grant food to every creature, for Thy grace is everlasting. Thanks to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Thy bounty we have never lacked food, nor ever shall lack it, for Thy great name&apos;s sake. For Thou suppliest and providest for all; Thou are bountiful, and nourishest all Thy creatures which Thou has made. Blessed be Thou, O God, that dost provide for all.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Exodus Continued...</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">That evening, quails came up and covered the camp; while in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp. When the dew had evaporated, there on the surface of the desert was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground. When the people of Isra’el saw it, they asked each other, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Man hu?</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> [What is it?]” because they didn’t know what it was. Moshe answered them, “It is the bread which </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has given you to eat. Here is what </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has ordered: each man is to gather according to his appetite — each is to take an </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">‘omer</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> [two quarts] per person for everyone in his tent.” The people of Isra’el did this. Some gathered more, some less; but when they put it in an </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">‘omer-</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">measure, whoever had gathered much had no excess; and whoever had gathered little had no shortage; nevertheless each person had gathered according to his appetite.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moshe told them, “No one is to leave any of it till morning.” But they didn’t pay attention to Moshe, and some kept the leftovers until morning. It bred worms and rotted, which made Moshe angry at them. So they gathered it morning after morning, each person according to his appetite; but as the sun grew hot, it melted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">‘omer</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">s per person; and all the community leaders came and reported to Moshe. He told them, “This is what </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has said: ‘Tomorrow is a holy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Shabbat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> for </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">. Bake what you want to bake; boil what you want to boil; and whatever is left over, set aside and keep for the morning.’” They set it aside till morning, as Moshe had ordered; and it didn’t rot or have worms. Moshe said, “Today, eat that; because today is a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Shabbat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> for </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> — today you won’t find it in the field. Gather it six days, but the seventh day is the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Shabbat —</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> on that day there won’t be any.” However, on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather and found none.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to Moshe, “How long will you refuse to observe my </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">mitzvot</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and teachings? Look, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has given you the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Shabbat.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> This is why he is providing bread for two days on the sixth day.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The people called the food </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">man</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">. It was like coriander seed, white; and it tasted like honey cakes. Moshe said, “Here is what </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> has ordered: ‘Let two quarts of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">man</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> be kept through all your generations, so that they will be able to see the bread which I fed you in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.’” Moshe said to Aharon, “Take a jar, put in it two quarts of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">man</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, and set it aside before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> to be kept through all your generations.” Just as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> ordered Moshe, Aharon set it aside before the testimony to be kept. The people of Isra’el ate </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">man</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> for forty years, until they came to an inhabited land.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The whole community of the people of Isra’el left the Seen Desert, traveling in stages, as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had ordered, and camped at Refidim; but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moshe, demanding, “Give us water to drink!” But Moshe replied, “Why pick a fight with me? Why are you testing </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">?” However, the people were thirsty for water there and grumbled against Moshe, “For what did you bring us up from Egypt? To kill us, our children and our livestock with thirst?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Miriam&apos;s Well</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Relieved as they were of all the cares of subsistence through the gift of manna, it was plainly the duty of the Israelites to devote themselves exclusively to the study of the Torah. When, therefore, they slackened in the performance of this duty, punishment in the form of lack of water immediately overtook them. This was the first time that they actually experienced this want, for at Marah nothing more than alarm that this need might come upon them, had caused them to murmur and complain. In their distress they once more unreasonably cast reproaches upon their leader, and disputed with him, saying: &quot;Wherefore is this, children, that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, and our children, and our cattle with thirst?&quot; Moses replied: &quot;As often as you quarrel with me, you tempt God, but God performeth wonders and excellent deeds for you, as often as you dispute with me, that His name may sound in glory throughout the world.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">In spite of the injury they had done him, Moses prayed to God that He might aid them in their distress and also stand by him. &quot;O Lord of the world!&quot; said he, &quot;I am surely doomed to die. Thou biddest me not to be offended with them, but if I obey Thy words, I shall certainly be killed by them.&quot; God, however, replied: &quot;Try thou to act like Me; as I return good for evil, so do thou return to them good for evil, and forgive their trespass; go on before the people, and We shall see who dares touch thee.&quot; Hardly had Moses shown himself to the people, when all of them rose reverently from their seats, whereupon God said to Moses: &quot;How often have I told thee not to be angry with them, but to lead them, as a shepherd leads his flock; it is for their sake that I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">have set thee on this height, and only for their sake wilt thou find grace, goodwill, and mercy in My sight.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Then God bade him go with some elders to the rock on Horeb, and fetch water out of it. The elders were to accompany him there, that they might be convinced that he was not bringing water from a well, but smiting it from a rock. To accomplish this miracle, God bade him smite the rock with his rod, as the people labored under the impression that this rod could only bring destruction, for through its agency Moses had brought the ten plagues upon the Egyptians in Egypt, and at the Red Sea; now they were to see that it could work good also. Upon God&apos;s bidding, Moses told the people to choose from which rock they wished water to flow, and hardly had Moses touched with his sapphire rod the rock which they had chosen, when plenteous water flowed from it. The spot where this occurred, God called Massah, and Meribah, because Israel had there tried their God, saying, &quot;If God is Lord over all, as over us; if He satisfies our needs, and will further show us that He knows our thoughts, then will we serve Him, but not otherwise.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The water that flowed for them on this spot served not only as a relief for their present need, but on this occasion there was revealed to them a well of water, which did not abandon them in all their forty years&apos; wandering, but accompanied them on all their marches. God wrought this great miracle for the merits of the prophetess Miriam, wherefore also it was called &quot;Miriam&apos;s Well.&quot; But his well dates back to the beginning of the world, for God created it on the second day of the creation, and at one time it was in the possession of Abraham. It was this same well that Abraham demanded back from Abimelech, king of the Philistines, after the king&apos;s servants had violently taken it away. But when Abimelech pretended not to know anything about it, saying, &quot;I wot not who hath done this thing,&quot; Abraham said: &quot;Thou and I will send sheep to the well, and he shall be declared the rightful owner of the well, for whose sheep the water will spout forth to water them. And,&quot; continued Abraham, &quot;from that same well shall the seventh generation after me, the wanderers in the desert, draw their supply.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">This well was in the shape of a sieve-like rock, out of which water gushes forth as from a spout. It followed them on all their wanderings, up hill and down dale, and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">wherever they halted, it halted, too, and it settled opposite the Tabernacle. Thereupon the leaders of the twelve tribes would appear, each with his staff and chant these words to the well, &quot;Spring up, O well, sing ye unto it; nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves.&quot; Then the water would gush forth from the depths of the well, and shoot up high as pillars, then discharge itself into great streams that were navigable, and on these rivers the Jews sailed to the ocean, and hauled all the treasures of the world therefrom.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The different parts of the camp were separated by these rivers, so that women, visiting each other, were obliged to make use of ships. Then the water discharged itself beyond the encampment, where it surrounded a great plain, in which grew every conceivable kind of plant and tree; and these trees, owing to the miraculous water, daily bore fresh fruits. This well brought fragrant herbs with it, so that the women had no need of perfumes on the march, for the herbs they gathered served this purpose. This well furthermore threw down soft, fragrant kinds of grass that served as pleasant couches for the poor, who had no pillows or bedclothes. Upon the entrance to the Holy Land this well disappeared and was hidden in a certain spot of the Sea of Tiberias. Standing upon Carmel, and looking over the sea, one can notice there a sieve-like rock, and that is the well of Miriam. Once upon a time it happened that a leper bathed at this place of the Sea of Tiberias, and hardly had he come in contact with the waters of Miriam&apos;s well when he was instantly healed.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moshe cried out to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, “What am I to do with these people? They’re ready to stone me!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> answered Moshe, “Go on ahead of the people, and bring with you the leaders of Isra’el. Take your staff in your hand, the one you used to strike the river; and go. I will stand in front of you there on the rock in Horev. You are to strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so the people can drink.” Moshe did this in the sight of the leaders of Isra’el. The place was named Massah [testing] and M’rivah [quarreling] because of the quarreling of the people of Isra’el and because they tested </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> by asking, “Is </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> with us or not?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Then ‘Amalek came and fought with Isra’el at Refidim. Moshe said to Y’hoshua, “Choose men for us, go out, and fight with ‘Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on top of <text:soft-page-break/>the hill with God’s staff in my hand.” Y’hoshua did as Moshe had told him and fought with ‘Amalek. Then Moshe, Aharon and Hur went up to the top of the hill. When Moshe raised his hand, Isra’el prevailed; but when he let it down, ‘Amalek prevailed. However, Moshe’s hands grew heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aharon and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other; so that his hands stayed steady until sunset. Thus Y’hoshua defeated ‘Amalek, putting their people to the sword.</text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_3" text:outline-level="4">Haggada - Amalek Defeated</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses now instructed Joshua in regard to his campaign against Amalek, saying, &quot;Choose us out men and go out, fight with Amalek.&quot; The words &quot;choose us&quot; characterize the modesty of Moses, who treated his disciple Joshua as an equal; in these words he has taught us that the honor of our disciples should stand as high as our own. Joshua did not at first want to expose himself to danger and leave the protection of the cloud, but Moses said to him, &quot;Abandon the cloud and set forth against Amalek, if ever thou dost hope to set the crown upon thy head.&quot; He commanded him to choose his warriors from among the pious and God-fearing, and promised him that he would set a fast day for the following day, and implore God, in behalf of the good deeds of the Patriarchs and the wives of the Patriarchs, to stand by Israel in this war.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Joshua acted in accordance with these commands and set out against Amalek, to conquer whom required not only skillful strategy, but also adeptness in the art of magic. For Amalek was a great magician and knew that propitious and the unpropitious hour of each individual, and in this way regulated his attacks against Israel; he attacked that one at night, whose death had been predicted for a night, and him whose death had been preordained for a day did he attack by day.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">But in this art, too, Joshua was his match, for he, too, knew how to time properly the attack upon individuals, and he destroyed Amalek, his sons, the armies he himself commanded, and those under the leadership of his sons. But in the very heat of battle, Joshua treated his enemies humanely, he did not repay like with like. Far was it from him to follow Amalek&apos;s example in mutilating the corpses of the enemy. Instead with a sharp sword he cut off the enemies&apos; heads, an execution that does not dishonor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">But only through the aid of Moses, did Joshua with his victory. Moses did not go out into battle, but through his prayer and through his influence upon the people in inspiring them with faith, the battle was won. While the battle raged between Israel and Amalek, Moses was stationed on a height, where, supported by the Levite Aaron and the Judean Hur, the representatives of the two noble tribes Levi and Judah, he fervently implored God&apos;s aid. He said: &quot;O Lord of the world! Through me has Thou brought Israel out of Egypt, through me hast Thou cleft the sea, and through me has Thou wrought miracles; so do Thou now work miracles for me, and lend me victory to Israel, for I well know that while all other nations fight only to the sixth hour of the day, this sinful nation stand in battle ranks till sunset.&quot; Moses did not consider it sufficient to pray alone to God, but he raised his hands toward heaven as a signal for the whole nation to follow his example and trust in God. As often as he then raised his hands to heaven and the people prayed with him, trusting that God would lend them victory, they were indeed victorious; as often, however, as Moses let down his hands and the people ceased prayer, weakening in their faith in God, Amalek conquered. But it was hard for Moses constantly to raise his hands. This was God&apos;s way of punishing him for being somewhat negligent in the preparations for the war against Amalek. Hence Aaron and Hur were obliged to hold up his arms and assist him in his prayer. As, furthermore, he was unable to stand all that time, he seated himself on a stone, disdaining a soft and comfortable seat, saying, &quot;So long as Israel is in distress, I shall share it with them.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At evenfall, the battle was not yet decided, therefore Moses prayed to God that He might stay the setting of the sun and thus enable Israel to draw the battle to a close. God granted this prayer, for the sun did not set until Israel had completely destroyed their enemy. Thereupon Moses blessed Joshua with the words, &quot;Some day the sun </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">shall stand still for thy sake, as it did to-day for mine,&quot; and this blessing was later fulfilled at Gibeon, when the sun stood still to help Joshua in his battle against the Amorites.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Although Amalek had not received the merited punishment from the hands of Joshua, still his enterprise against Israel had not been entirely unavailing. The miraculous exodus of Israel out of Egypt, and especially the cleaving of the sea, had created such alarm among the heathens, that none among them had dared to approach Israel. But this fear vanished as soon as Amalek attempted to compete in battle with Israel. Although he was terrible beaten, still the fear of the inaccessibility of Israel was gone. It was with Amalek as with that foolhardy wight who plunged into a scalding-hot tub. He scalded himself terribly, yet the tub became cold through his plunge into it. Hence God was not content with the punishment Amalek received in the time of Moses, but swore by His throne and by His right hand that He would never forget Amalek&apos;s misdeeds, that in this world as well as in the time of the Messiah He would visit punishment upon him, and would completely exterminate him in the future world. So long as the seed of Amalek exist, the face of God is, as it were, covered, and will only then come to view, when the seed of Amalek shall have been entirely exterminated.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God had at first left the war against Amalek in the hands of His people, therefore He bade Joshua, the future leader of the people, never to forget the war against Amalek; and if Moses had listened intently, he would have perceived from this command of God that Joshua was destined to lead the people into the promised land. But later, when Amalek took part in the destruction of Jerusalem, God Himself took up the war against Amalek, saying, &quot;By My throne I vow not to leave a single descendant of Amalek under the heavens, yea, no one shall even be able to say that this sheep or that wether belonged to an Amalekite.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">God bade Moses impress upon the Jews to repulse no heathen should he desire conversion, but never to accept an Amalekite as a proselyte. It was in consideration of this word of God that David slew the Amalekite, who announced to him the death of Saul and Jonathan; for he saw in him only a heathen, although he appeared in the guise of a Jew.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Part of the blame for the destruction of Amalek falls upon his father, Eliphaz. He used to say to Amalek: &quot;My son, dost thou indeed know who will posses this world and the future world?&quot; Amalek paid no attention to his allusion to the future fortune of Israel, and his father urged it no more strongly upon him, although it would have been his duty to instruct his son clearly and fully. He should have said to him: &quot;My son, Israel will posses this world as well as the future world; dig wells then for their use and build road for them, so that thou mayest be judged worthy to share in the future world.&quot; But as Amalek had not been sufficiently instructed by his father, in his wantonness he undertook to destroy the whole world. God, who tries the reins and the heart, said to him: &quot;O thou fool, I created thee after all the seventy nations, but for thy sins thou shalt be the first to descend into hell.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">To glorify the victory over Amalek, Moses built an altar, which God called &quot;My Miracle,&quot; for the miracle God wrought against Amalek in the war of Israel was, as it were, a miracle for God. For so long as the Israelites dwell in sorrow, God feels with them, and a joy for Israel is a joy for God, hence, too, the miraculous victory over Israel&apos;s foe was a victory for God.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">&quot;Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware.&quot; The destruction of Amalek brought Jethro to his senses. Jethro was originally in the same plot with Amalek, both having incited Pharaoh against Israel, but when he saw that Amalek lost this world and the other, he repented of his sinful ways, saying: &quot;There is nothing left to me but to go over to the God of Israel&quot;; and although he dwelt in the greatest wealth and honor, he determined to set out for the desert, to Moses and his God. Arrived at the camp of Israel, he could not enter it, for it was enveloped by a cloud that none could pierce, hence he wrote a letter to Moses and shot it off with an arrow, so that it fell into the camp. The letter read: &quot;I adjure thee, by thy two sons and by thy God, to come to meet me and receive me kindly. If thou wilt not do if for my sake, do it for thy wife&apos;s sake; and if thou wilt not do it for her sake, do it for thy sons&apos; sake.&quot; For Jethro brought with him his daughter Zipporah, from whom Moses had been divorced, as well as her two sons, her only children, for after her separation from Moses, she had wed no other man.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">At first Moses was inclined to give no ear to this letter, but God said to him: &quot;I, through whose word the world came into being, I bring men to Me and do not thrust them back. I permitted Jethro to approach Me, and did not push him from Me. So do thou, too, receive this man, who desires to betake himself under the wings of the Shekinah, let him approach, and do not repulse him.&quot; God herewith taught Moses that one should repulse with the left hand, and beckon with the right.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, together with the seventy elders of Israel, carrying with them the sacred Ark, hastened to welcome Jethro kindly; and Moses so honored his father-in-law as to make an obeisance before him and kiss him. Before Moses told his father-in-law of the great miracles God had wrought for Egypt, such as the exodus from Egypt, the cleaving of the sea, the rain of manna, and the rest, he offered him the greeting of peace; for great is peace, that precedes event he praise of God. After the peace-greeting, Moses, to draw his father-in-law nearer to true faith in God and His revelation, began to relate to him the miracles that God had wrought </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">for them at the exodus from Egypt, during the passing through the Red Sea, and during the war with Amalek. He said, moreover, &quot;In the manna that God gives us we perceive the taste of bread, of meat, of fish, in short, of all the dishes there are. Out of the well that God gives us we draw a drink that possesses the taste of old wine as well as new, of milk and of honey, in short, of all the beverages that exist.&quot; &quot;We shall,&quot; Moses continued, &quot;receive six other gifts from God, the land of Israel, the future world, the new world, the sovereignty of David, the institution of priests, and of Levites.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">When Jethro heard all this, he determined to become a Jew and to believe in the only God, and although he felt a pang at heart upon hearing that the Egyptians had perished-for no one should scoff at a heathen before a proselyte who is not a Jew of ten generation&apos;s standing-still he burst into a song of praise to God for the deeds He had one for His people. In truth, it reflects shame upon Moses and the sixty myriads of Jews that they had not given thanks to God for the release from Egypt, until Jethro came and did so. He said: &quot;Praised be God who delivered Moses and Aaron, as well as the whole nation of Israel, from the bondage of Pharaoh, that great dragon, and of the Egyptians. Truly, great is the Lord before all gods, for whereas formerly not a single slave succeeded in escaping from Egypt, He led sixty myriads out of Egypt. There is no god whom I had not, at some time in my life, worshipped, but not I must admit that none is like the God of Israel. This God had not been unbeknown to me heretofore, but now I know Him better, for His fame will sound throughout the world, because He visited upon the Egyptians exactly what they had planned to undertake against Israel. They wanted to destroy Israel by water, and by water were they destroyed.&quot;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">With sacrifices and a feast was the arrival of Jethro celebrated, for after he had made the burnt offering not far from the bush of thorns that had been unscathed by fire, Jethro prepared a feast of rejoicing for the whole people, at which Moses did not consider it below the dignity to wait on the guests in person. In this he followed the example of Abraham, who in person waited on the three angels, though they appeared in the guise of idolatrous Arabs.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">Abraham like Moses sought to follow in the ways of the Lord, to provide each according to his wants, and to grant to everybody what he lacks, whether he be a righteous man, or an idolater, who through his sins conjures up God&apos;s wrath.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">To this feast the people sat down according to their tribes. They ate, drank and were merry, while Aaron and Jethro with their relatives sang songs of thanksgiving to God, and praised Him as the Creator and Donor of their lives and their liberty. At the same time they gave due appreciation to Moses, through whose courage everything had happily come to pass. In his words of gratitude to Moses, Jethro also gave expression to many glorious eulogies on the people of Israel, but he especially extolled Moses, who through difficulties and dangers had shown so much courage in the salvation of his friends.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Now Yitro the priest of Midyan, Moshe’s father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moshe and for Isra’el his people, how </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had brought Isra’el out of Egypt. After Moshe had sent away his wife Tzipporah and her two sons, Yitro Moshe’s father-in-law had taken them back. The name of the one son was Gershom, for Moshe had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.” The name of the other was Eli‘ezer [my God helps], “because the God of my father helped me by rescuing me from Pharaoh’s sword.” Yitro Moshe’s father-in-law brought Moshe’s sons and wife to him in the desert where he was encamped, at the mountain of God. He sent word to Moshe, “I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moshe went out to meet his father-in-law, prostrated himself and kissed him.

Yitro rejoiced over all the good that </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had done for Isra’el by rescuing them from the Egyptians. Yitro said, “Blessed be </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, who has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, who has rescued the people from the harsh hand of the Egyptians.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(ii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> The following day Moshe sat to settle disputes for the people, while the people stood around Moshe from morning till evening. When Moshe’s father-in-law saw all that he was doing to the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing to the people? Why do you sit there alone, with all the people standing around you from morning till evening?” Moshe answered his father-in-law, “It’s because the people come to me seeking God’s guidance. Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me; I judge between one person and another, and I explain to them God’s laws and teachings.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Moshe’s father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing isn’t good. You will certainly wear yourself out — and not only yourself, but these people here with you as well. It’s too much for you — you can’t do it alone, by yourself. So listen now to what I have to say. I will give you some advice, and God will be with you. You should represent the people before God, and you should bring their cases to God. You should also teach them the laws and the teachings, and show them how to live their lives and what work they should do. But you should choose from among all the people competent men who are God-fearing, honest and incorruptible to be their leaders, in charge of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. Normally, they will settle the people’s disputes. They should bring you the difficult cases; but ordinary matters they should decide themselves. In this way, they will make it easier for you and share the load with you. If you do this — and God is directing you to do it — you will be able to endure; and all these people too will arrive at their destination peacefully.”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">In the third month after the people of Isra’el had left the land of Egypt, the same day they came to the Sinai Desert.

If he came single, he is to leave single; if he was married when he came, his wife is to go with him when he leaves. But if his master gave him a wife, and she bore him sons or daughters, then the wife and her children will belong to her master, and he will leave by himself. Nevertheless, if the slave declares, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children, so I don’t want to go free,’ then his master is to bring him before God; and there at the door or doorpost, his master is to pierce his ear with an awl; and the man will be his slave for life.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to go free like the men-slaves. If her master married her but decides she no longer pleases him, then he is to allow her to be redeemed. He is not allowed to sell her to a foreign people, because he has treated her unfairly. If he has her marry his son, then he is to treat her like a daughter. If he marries another wife, he is not to reduce her food, clothing or marital rights. If he fails to provide her with these three things, she is to be given her freedom without having to pay anything.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Whoever attacks a person and causes his death must be put to death. If it was not premeditated but an act of God, then I will designate for you a place to which he can flee.

   <text:p text:style-name="P6">When the people saw that Moshe was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, they gathered around Aharon and said to him, “Get busy; and make us gods to go ahead of us; because this Moshe, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt — we don’t know what has become of him.” Aharon said to them, “Have your wives, sons and daughters strip off their gold earrings; and bring them to me.” The people stripped off their gold earrings and brought them to Aharon. He received what they gave him, melted it down, and made it into the shape of a calf. They said, “Isra’el! Here is your god, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!” On seeing this, Aharon built an altar in front of it and proclaimed, “Tomorrow is to be a feast for <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span>.” Early the next morning they got up and offered burnt offerings and presented peace offerings. Afterwards, the people sat down to eat and drink; then they got up to indulge in revelry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span> said to Moshe, “Go down! Hurry! Your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have become corrupt! So quickly they have turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow! They have cast a metal statue of a calf, worshipped it, sacrificed to it and said, ‘Isra’el! Here is your god, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’” <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span> continued speaking to Moshe: “I have been watching these people; and you can see how stiffnecked they are. Now leave me alone, so that my anger can blaze against them, and I can put an end to them! I will make a great nation out of you instead.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Moshe pleaded with <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span> his God. He said, “<text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span>, why must your anger blaze against your own people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand? Why let the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intentions that he led them out, to slaughter them in the hills and wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger! Relent! Don’t bring such disaster on your people! Remember Avraham, Yitz’chak and Isra’el, your servants, to whom you swore by your very self. You promised them, ‘I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky; and I will give all this land I have spoken about to your descendants; and they will possess it forever.’” <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span> then changed his mind about the disaster he had planned for his people.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Moshe turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets inscribed on both sides, on the front and on the back. The tablets were the work of God; and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. When Y’hoshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to Moshe, “It sounds like war in the camp!” He <text:soft-page-break/>answered, “That is neither the clamor of victory nor the wailings of defeat; what I hear is the sound of people singing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">But the moment Moshe got near the camp, when he saw the calf and the dancing, his own anger blazed up. He threw down the tablets he had been holding and shattered them at the base of the mountain. Seizing the calf they had made, he melted it in the fire and ground it to powder, which he scattered on the water. Then he made the people of Isra’el drink it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Moshe said to Aharon, “What did these people do to you to make you lead them into such a terrible sin?” Aharon replied, “My lord shouldn’t be so angry. You know what these people are like, that they are determined to do evil. So they said to me, ‘Make us gods to go ahead of us; because this Moshe, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt — we don’t know what has become of him.’ I answered them, ‘Anyone with gold, strip it off!’ So they gave it to me. I threw it in the fire, and out came this calf!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">When Moshe saw that the people had gotten out of control — because Aharon had allowed them to get out of control, to the derision of their enemies — Moshe stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, “Whoever is for <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span>, come to me!” All the descendants of Levi rallied around him. He told them, “Here is what <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span>, the God of Isra’el, says: ‘Each of you, put his sword on his side; and go up and down the camp, from gate to gate; and every man is to kill his own kinsman, his own friend and his own neighbor!” The sons of Levi did what Moshe said, and that day three thousand of the people died. Moshe said, “You have consecrated yourselves today to <text:span text:style-name="T20">Adonai</text:span>, because every one of you has been against his own son and against his own kinsman, in order to bring a blessing on yourselves today.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">The next day Moshe said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin. Now I will go up to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> ; maybe I will be able to atone for your sin.” Moshe went back to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> and said, “Please! These people have committed a terrible sin: they have made themselves a god out of gold. Now, if you will just forgive their sin! But if you won’t, then, I beg you, blot me out of your book which you have written!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> answered Moshe, “Those who have sinned against me are the ones I will blot out of my book. Now go and lead the people to the place I told you about; my angel will go ahead of you. Nevertheless, the time for punishment will come; and then I will punish them for their sin.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> struck the people with a plague because they had made the calf, the one Aharon made.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P60" text:outline-level="3"><text:bookmark text:name="_k9m74af4ivw6"/>Exodus 33</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to Moshe, “Leave, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt; and move on from here toward the land of which I swore to Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I will send an angel ahead of you; and I will drive out the Kena‘ani, Emori, Hitti, P’rizi, Hivi and Y’vusi. You will go to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I myself will not go with you, because you are such a stiffnecked people that I might destroy you on the way.” When the people heard this bad news, they went into mourning; and no one wore his ornaments. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> said to Moshe, “Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘You are a stiffnecked people! If I were to go up with you for even one moment, I would exterminate you! Now, keep your ornaments off; then I will decide what to do to you.’” So from Mount Horev onward, the people of Isra’el stripped themselves of their ornaments.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T15">Moshe would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp. He called it the tent of meeting. Everyone who wanted to consult </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> would go out to the tent of meeting, outside the camp. Whenever Moshe went out to the tent, all the people would get up and stand, each man at his tent door, and look at Moshe until he had gone into the tent. Whenever Moshe entered the tent, the column of cloud would descend and station itself at the entrance to the tent; and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> would speak with Moshe. When all the people saw the column of cloud stationed at the entrance to the tent, they would get up and prostrate themselves, each man at his tent door. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> would speak to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then he would return to the camp; but the young man who was his assistant, Y’hoshua the son of Nun, never left the inside of the tent.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T18">(iii)</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> Moshe said to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">, “Look, you say to me, ‘Make these people move on!’ But you haven’t let me know whom you will be sending with me. Nevertheless you have said, ‘I know you by name,’ and also, ‘You have found favor in my sight.’ Now, please, if it is really the case that I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways; so that I will understand you and continue finding favor in your sight. Moreover, keep on seeing this nation as your people.” He answered, “Set your mind at rest — my presence will go with you, after all.” Moshe replied, “If your presence doesn’t go with </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">us, don’t make us go on from here. For how else is it to be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, other than by your going with us? That is what distinguishes us, me and your people, from all the other peoples on earth.”</text:span></text:p>

But my face,” he continued, “you cannot see, because a human being cannot look at me and remain alive. Here,” he said, “is a place near me; stand on the rock. When my glory passes by, I will put you inside a crevice in the rock and cover you with my hand, until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face is not to be seen.”</text:span></text:p>

Be ready by morning; in the morning you are to ascend Mount Sinai and present yourself to me on the top of the mountain. No one is to come up with you, and no one is to be seen anywhere on the mountain; don’t even let the flocks or herds feed in front of this mountain.” Moshe cut two stone tablets like the first. Then he got up early in the morning and, with the two stone tablets in his hands, ascended Mount Sinai, as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Adonai</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15"> had ordered him to do.</text:span></text:p>

He made fifty loops on the one sheet, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the sheet in the second set; the loops were opposite one another.

   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He made the planks for the tabernacle as follows: twenty planks for the south side, facing southward. He made forty silver sockets under the twenty planks, two sockets under one plank for its two projections and two sockets under another plank for its two projections. For the second side of the tabernacle, to the north, he made twenty planks and their forty silver sockets, two sockets under one plank and two under another. For the rear part of the tabernacle, toward the west, he made six planks. For the corners of the tabernacle in the rear he made two planks, double from the bottom all the way to the top but joined at a single ring. He did the same with both of them at the two corners. Thus there were eight planks with their silver sockets, sixteen sockets, two sockets under each plank.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">He made crossbars of acacia-wood, five for the planks of the one side of the tabernacle, five crossbars for the planks of the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for the planks at the side of the tabernacle at the rear toward the west. He made the middle crossbar so that it extended from one end of the planks to the other, halfway up. He overlaid the planks with gold, made gold rings for them through which the crossbars could pass and overlaid the crossbars with gold.</text:p>

Chapters 6–7 go over much the same ground, but from the point of view of the priest, who, as the one actually carrying out the sacrifice and dividing the &quot;portions&quot;, needs to know how to do it. Sacrifices are between God, the priest, and the offerers, although in some cases the entire sacrifice is a single portion to God—i.e., burnt to ashes.</text:span><text:a xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Leviticus#cite_note-10" text:style-name="Standard" text:visited-style-name="Standard"><text:span text:style-name="T2">[10]</text:span></text:a></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:span text:style-name="T9">With sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11–15 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness). Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth; certain skin diseases (but not all) are unclean, as are certain conditions affecting walls and clothing (mildew and similar conditions); and genital discharges, including female menses and male gonorrhea, are unclean. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of &quot;life force&quot;, usually but not always blood.</text:span><text:a xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Leviticus#cite_note-12" text:style-name="Standard" text:visited-style-name="Standard"><text:span text:style-name="T2">[12]</text:span></text:a></text:p>

But if you have in fact gone astray while under your husband’s authority and become unclean, because some man other than your husband has gone to bed with you . . .” then the cohen is to make the woman swear with an oath that includes a curse; the cohen will say to the woman, “. . .may Adonai make you an object of cursing and condemnation among your people by making your private parts shrivel and your abdomen swell up! May this water that causes the curse go into your inner parts and make your abdomen swell and your private parts shrivel up!” — and the woman is to respond, “Amen! Amen!” The cohen is to write these curses on a scroll, wash them off into the water of embitterment and make the woman drink the water of embitterment and cursing — the water of cursing will enter her and become bitter. Then the cohen is to remove the grain offering for jealousy from the woman’s hand, wave the grain offering before Adonai and bring it to the altar. The cohen is to take a handful of the grain offering as its reminder portion and make it go up in smoke on the altar; afterwards, he is to make the woman drink the water. When he has made her drink the water, then, if she is unclean and has been unfaithful to her husband, the water that causes the curse will enter her and become bitter, so that her abdomen swells and her private parts shrivel up; and the woman will become an object of cursing among her people. But if the woman is not unclean but clean, then she will be innocent and will have children. This is the law for jealousy: when either a wife under her husband’s authority goes astray and becomes unclean, or the spirit of jealousy comes over a husband and he becomes jealous of his wife, then he is to place the woman before Adonai, and the cohen is to deal with her in accordance with all of this law.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">This was the offering for dedicating the altar which was given by the leaders of Isra’el on the day of its anointing: twelve silver dishes, twelve silver basins and twelve gold pans. Each silver dish weighed 130 shekels [three-and-a-quarter pounds] and each basin seventy shekels [one-and-three-quarters pounds]; all the silver of the vessels weighed 2,400 shekels (using the sanctuary shekel) [just over sixty pounds]. The twelve gold pans, full of incense, weighed ten shekels apiece (using the sanctuary shekel) [one-quarter pound]; all the gold of the pans weighed 120 shekels [three pounds].

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">When Moshe went into the tent of meeting in order to speak with Adonai, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the ark-cover on the ark for the testimony, from between the two k’ruvim; and he spoke to him.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 8</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Tell Aharon, ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to cast their light forward, in front of the menorah.’” Aharon did this: he lit its lamps so as to give light in front of the menorah, as Adonai had ordered Moshe. Here is how the menorah was made: it was hammered gold from its base to its flowers, hammered work, following the pattern Adonai had shown Moshe. This is how he made the menorah.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Take the L’vi’im from among the people of Isra’el and cleanse them. Here is how you are to cleanse them: sprinkle the purification water on them, have them shave their whole body with a razor, and have them wash their clothes and cleanse themselves. Then they are to take a young bull with its grain offering, which is to be fine flour mixed with olive oil; while you take another bull for a sin offering. You are to present the L’vi’im in front of the tent of meeting, and assemble the entire community of the people of Isra’el. You will present the L’vi’im before Adonai, the people of Isra’el will lay their hands on the L’vi’im, and Aharon will offer the L’vi’im before Adonai as a wave offering from the people <text:soft-page-break/>of Isra’el, so that they may do Adonai’s service. The L’vi’im will lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; the one you will offer as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to Adonai to make atonement for the L’vi’im. You are to place the L’vi’im before Aharon and his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Adonai. In this way you will separate the L’vi’im from the people of Isra’el, and the L’vi’im will belong to me.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(ii) “After that, the L’vi’im will enter and do the service of the tent of meeting. You will cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering, because they are entirely given to me from among the people of Isra’el; I have taken them for myself in place of all those who come first out of the womb, that is, the firstborn males of the people of Isra’el. For all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el are mine, both humans and animals; on the day I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set them apart for myself. But I have taken the L’vi’im in place of all the firstborn among the people of Isra’el, and I have given the L’vi’im to Aharon and his sons from among the people of Isra’el to do the service of the people of Isra’el in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the people of Isra’el, so that no plague will fall on the people of Isra’el in consequence of their coming too close to the sanctuary.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">This is what Moshe, Aharon and all the community of the people of Isra’el did to the L’vi’im. The people of Isra’el acted in accordance with everything that Adonai had ordered Moshe in regard to the L’vi’im. The L’vi’im purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aharon offered them as a holy gift before Adonai and made atonement for them in order to cleanse them. After that, the L’vi’im came to do their service in the tent of meeting in front of Aharon and his sons; they acted in accordance with Adonai’s orders to Moshe in regard to the L’vi’im.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Here are instructions concerning the L’vi’im: when they reach the age of twenty-five, they are to begin performing their duties serving in the tent of meeting; and when they reach the age of fifty, they are to stop performing this work and not serve any longer. They will assist their brothers who are performing their duties in the tent of meeting, but they themselves will not do any of the work. This is what you are to do with the L’vi’im in regard to their duties.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 9</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(iii) Adonai spoke to Moshe in the Sinai Desert in the first month of the second year after they had left the land of Egypt; he said, “Let the people of Isra’el observe Pesach at its designated time. On the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, you are to observe it — at its <text:soft-page-break/>designated time. You are to observe it according to all its regulations and rules.” Moshe told the people of Isra’el to observe Pesach. So they observed Pesach at dusk on the fourteenth day of the month in the Sinai Desert; the people of Isra’el acted in accordance with all that Adonai had ordered Moshe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But there were certain people who had become unclean because of someone’s corpse, so that they could not observe Pesach on that day. So they came before Moshe and Aharon that day and said to him, “We are unclean because of someone’s corpse; but why must we be kept from bringing the offering for Adonai at the time designated for the people of Isra’el?” Moshe answered them, “Wait, so that I can hear what Adonai will order concerning you.” Adonai said to Moshe, “Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘If any of you now or in future generations is unclean because of a corpse, or if he is on a trip abroad, nevertheless he is to observe Pesach. But he will observe it in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk. They are to eat it with matzah and maror, they are to leave none of it until morning, and they are not to break any of its bones — they are to observe it according to all the regulations of Pesach. But the person who is clean and not on a trip who fails to observe Pesach will be cut off from his people; because he did not bring the offering for Adonai at its designated time, that person will bear the consequences of his sin. If a foreigner is staying with you and wants to observe Pesach for Adonai, he is to do it according to the regulations and rules of Pesach — you are to have the same law for the foreigner as for the citizen of the land.’”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(iv) On the day the tabernacle was put up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, that is, the tent of the testimony; and in the evening, over the tabernacle was what appeared to be fire, which remained until morning. So the cloud always covered it, and it looked like fire at night. Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent, the people of Isra’el continued their travels; and they camped wherever the cloud stopped. At the order of Adonai, the people of Isra’el traveled; at the order of Adonai, they camped; and as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they stayed in camp. Even when the cloud remained on the tabernacle for a long time, the people of Isra’el did what Adonai had charged them to do and did not travel. Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle; according to Adonai’s order, they remained in camp; and according to Adonai’s order, they traveled. Sometimes the cloud was there only from evening until morning; so that when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled. Or even if it continued up both day and night, when the cloud was up, they traveled. Whether it was two days, a month or a year that the cloud remained over the tabernacle, staying on it, the people of Isra’el remained in camp and did not travel; but as <text:soft-page-break/>soon as it was taken up, they traveled. At Adonai’s order, they camped; and at Adonai’s order, they traveled — they did what Adonai had charged them to do through Moshe.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 10</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Make two trumpets; make them of hammered silver. Use them for summoning the community and for sounding the call to break camp and move on. When they are sounded, the entire community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting. If only one is sounded, then just the leaders, the heads of the clans of Isra’el, are to assemble before you.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“When you sound an alarm, the camps to the east will commence traveling. When you sound a second alarm, the camps to the south will set out; they will sound alarms to announce when to travel. However, when the community is to be assembled, you are to sound; but don’t sound an alarm. It will be the sons of Aharon, the cohanim, who are to sound the trumpets; this will be a permanent regulation for you through all your generations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“When you go to war in your land against an adversary who is oppressing you, you are to sound an alarm with the trumpets; then you will be remembered before Adonai your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Also on your days of rejoicing, at your designated times and on Rosh-Hodesh, you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; these will be your reminder before your God. I am Adonai your God.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(v) On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony; and the people of Isra’el moved out in stages from the Sinai Desert. The cloud stopped in the Pa’ran Desert.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">So they set out on their first journey, in keeping with Adonai’s order through Moshe. In the lead was the banner of the camp of the descendants of Y’hudah, whose companies moved forward; over his company was Nachshon the son of ‘Amminadav. Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Yissakhar was N’tan’el the son of Tzu‘ar. Over the company of the descendants of Z’vulun was Eli’av the son of Helon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the descendants of Gershon and the descendants of M’rari set out, carrying the tabernacle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Next, the banner of the camp of Re’uven moved forward by companies; over his company was Elitzur the son of Sh’de’ur. Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Shim‘on was Shlumi’el the son of Tzurishaddai. Over the company of the descendants of Gad was Elyasaf the son of De‘u’el.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then the descendants of K’hat set out, carrying the sanctuary, so that [at the next camp] the tabernacle could be set up before they arrived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">The banner of the camp of the descendants of Efrayim moved forward by companies; over his company was Elishama the son of ‘Ammihud. Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of M’nasheh was Gamli’el the son of P’dahtzur. Over the company of the descendants of Binyamin was Avidan the son of Gid‘oni.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">The banner of the camp of the descendants of Dan, forming the rearguard for all the camps, moved forward by companies; over his company was Achi‘ezer the son of ‘Ammishaddai. Over the company of the tribe of the descendants of Asher was Pag‘i’el the son of ‘Okhran. Over the company of the descendants of Naftali was Achira the son of ‘Enan.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">This is how the people of Isra’el traveled by companies; thus they moved forward.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(S: vi) Moshe said to Hovav the son of Re‘u’el the Midyani, Moshe’s father-in-law, “We are traveling to the place about which Adonai said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, because Adonai has promised good things to Isra’el.” But he replied, “I will not go; I would rather go back to my own country and my own kinsmen.” Moshe continued, “Please don’t leave us, because you know that we have to camp in the desert, and you can serve as our eyes. If you do go with us, then whatever good Adonai does for us, we will do the same for you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">So they set out from Adonai’s mountain and traveled for three days. Ahead of them on this three-day journey went the ark of Adonai’s covenant, searching for a new place to stop. The cloud of Adonai was over them during the day as they set out from the camp. (A: vi) When the ark moved forward, Moshe said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">“Arise, Adonai! May your enemies be scattered!</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">Let those who hate you flee before you!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">When it stopped, he said,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">“Return, Adonai of the many, many</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">thousands of Isra’el!”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 11</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But the people began complaining about their hardships to Adonai. When Adonai heard it, his anger flared up, so that fire from Adonai broke out against them and consumed the outskirts of the camp. Then the people cried to Moshe, Moshe prayed to Adonai, and the fire abated. That place was called Tav‘erah [burning] because Adonai’s fire broke out against them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Next, the mixed crowd that was with them grew greedy for an easier life; while the people of Isra’el, for their part, also renewed their weeping and said, “If only we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt — it cost us nothing! — and the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, the garlic! But now we’re withering away, we have nothing to look at but this man.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">The man, by the way, was like coriander seed and white like gum resin. The people would go around gathering it and would grind it up in mills or pound it to paste with mortar and pestle. Then they would cook it in pots and make it into loaves that tasted like cakes baked with olive oil. When the dew settled on the camp during the night, the man came with it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe heard the people crying, family after family, each person at the entrance to his tent; the anger of Adonai flared up violently; and Moshe too was displeased. Moshe asked Adonai, “Why are you treating your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, so that you put the burden of this entire people on me? Did I conceive this people? Was I their father, so that you tell me, ‘Carry them in your arms, like a nurse carrying a baby, to the land you swore to their ancestors?’ Where am I going to get meat to give to this entire people? — because they keep bothering me with their crying and saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ I can’t carry this entire people by myself alone — it’s too much for me! If you are going to treat me this way, then just kill me outright! — please, if you have any mercy toward me! — and don’t let me go on being this miserable!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/>Adonai said to Moshe, “Bring me seventy of the leaders of Isra’el, people you recognize as leaders of the people and officers of theirs. Bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them stand there with you. I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit which rests on you and put it on them. Then they will carry the burden of the people along with you, so that you won’t carry it yourself alone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Tell the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; because you cried in the ears of Adonai, “If only we had meat to eat! We had the good life in Egypt!” All right, Adonai is going to give you meat, and you will eat it. You won’t eat it just one day, or two days, or five, or ten, or twenty days, but a whole month! — until it comes out of your nose and you hate it! — because you have rejected Adonai, who is here with you, and distressed him with your crying and asking, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But Moshe said, “Here I am with six hundred thousand men on foot, and yet you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’ If whole flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would it be enough? If all the fish in the sea were collected for them, would even that be enough?” Adonai answered Moshe, “Has Adonai’s arm grown short? Now you will see whether what I said will happen or not!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe went out and told the people what Adonai had said. Then he collected seventy of the leaders of the people and placed them all around the tent. Adonai came down in the cloud, spoke to him, took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy leaders. When the Spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied — then but not afterwards.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">There were two men who stayed in the camp, one named Eldad and the other Medad, and the Spirit came to rest on them. They were among those listed to go out to the tent, but they hadn’t done so, and they prophesied in the camp. A young man ran and told Moshe, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” Y’hoshua, the son of Nun, who from his youth up had been Moshe’s assistant, answered, “My lord, Moshe, stop them!” But Moshe replied, “Are you so zealous to protect me? I wish all of Adonai’s people were prophets! I wish Adonai would put his Spirit on all of them!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(vii) Moshe and the leaders of Isra’el went back into the camp; and Adonai sent out a wind which brought quails from across the sea and let them fall near the camp, about a day’s trip away on each side of the camp and all around it, covering the ground to a depth of three feet. The people stayed up all that day, all night and all the next day gathering the quails — <text:soft-page-break/>the person gathering the least collected ten heaps; then they spread them out for themselves all around the camp. But while the meat was still in their mouth, before they had chewed it up, the anger of Adonai flared up against the people, and Adonai struck the people with a terrible plague. Therefore that place was named Kivrot-HaTa’avah [graves of greed], because there they buried the people who were so greedy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">From Kivrot-HaTa’avah the people traveled to Hatzerot, and they stayed at Hatzerot.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 12</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Miryam and Aharon began criticizing Moshe on account of the Ethiopian woman he had married, for he had in fact married an Ethiopian woman. They said, “Is it true that Adonai has spoken only with Moshe? Hasn’t he spoken with us too?” Adonai heard them. Now this man Moshe was very humble, more so than anyone on earth. Suddenly Adonai told Moshe, Aharon and Miryam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” The three of them went out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai came down in a column of cloud and stood at the entrance to the tent. He summoned Aharon and Miryam, and they both went forward. He said, “Listen to what I say: when there is a prophet among you, I, Adonai, make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. But it isn’t that way with my servant Moshe. He is the only one who is faithful in my entire household. With him I speak face to face and clearly, not in riddles; he sees the image of Adonai. So why weren’t you afraid to criticize my servant Moshe?” The anger of Adonai flared up against them, and he left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But when the cloud was removed from above the tent, Miryam had tzara‘at, as white as snow. Aharon looked at Miryam, and she was as white as snow. Aharon said to Moshe, “Oh, my lord, please don’t punish us for this sin we committed so foolishly. Please don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, with its body half eaten away when it comes out of its mother’s womb!” Moshe cried to Adonai, “Oh God, I beg you, please, heal her!” (Maftir) Adonai answered Moshe, “If her father had merely spit in her face, wouldn’t she hide herself in shame for seven days? So let her be shut out of the camp for seven days; after that, she can be brought back in.” Miryam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not travel until she was brought back in. Afterwards, the people went on from Hatzerot and camped in the Pa’ran Desert.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe sent them to reconnoiter the land of Kena‘an, instructing them, “Go on up to the Negev and into the hills, and see what the land is like. Notice the people living there, whether they are strong or weak, few or many; and what kind of country they live in, whether it is good or bad; and what kind of cities they live in, open or fortified. See whether the land is fertile or unproductive and whether there is wood in it or not. Finally, be bold enough to bring back some of the fruit of the land.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">When they left it was the season for the first grapes to ripen. (ii) They went up and reconnoitered the land from the Tzin Desert to Rechov near the entrance to Hamat. They went up into the Negev and arrived at Hevron; Achiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the ‘Anakim, lived there. (Hevron was built seven years before Tzo‘an in Egypt.) They came to the Eshkol Valley; and there they cut off a branch bearing one cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two of them; they also took pomegranates and figs. That place was called the Valley of Eshkol [cluster], because of the cluster which the people of Isra’el cut down there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Forty days later, they returned from reconnoitering the land and went to Moshe, Aharon and the entire community of the people of Isra’el at Kadesh in the Pa’ran Desert, where they brought back word to them and to the entire community and showed them the fruit of the land. What they told him was this: “We entered the land where you sent us, and indeed it does flow with milk and honey — here is its fruit! However the people living in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the ‘Anakim there. ‘Amalek lives in the area of the Negev; the Hitti, the Y’vusi and the Emori live in the hills; and the Kena‘ani live by the sea and alongside the Yarden.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Kalev silenced the people around Moshe and said, “We ought to go up immediately and take possession of it; there is no question that we can conquer it.” But the men who had gone with him said, “We can’t attack those people, because they are stronger than we are”; and they spread a negative report about the land they had reconnoitered for the people of Isra’el by saying, “The land we passed through in order to spy it out is a land that devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there were giant! We saw the N’filim, the descendants of ‘Anak, who was from the N’filim; to ourselves we looked like grasshoppers by comparison, and we looked that way to them too!”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3">Numbers 14</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">At this all the people of Isra’el cried out in dismay and wept all night long. Moreover, all the people of Isra’el began grumbling against Moshe and Aharon; the whole community told them, “We wish we had died in the land of Egypt! or that we had died here in the desert! Why is Adonai bringing us to this land, where we will die by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be taken as booty! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?” And they said to each other, “Let’s appoint a leader and return to Egypt!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">Moshe and Aharon fell on their faces before the entire assembled community of the people of Isra’el. Y’hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y’funeh, from the detachment that had reconnoitered the land, tore their clothes and said to the whole community of Isra’el, “The land we passed through in order to spy it out is an outstandingly good land! (iii) If Adonai is pleased with us, then he will bring us into this land and give it to us — a land flowing with milk and honey. Just don’t rebel against Adonai. And don’t be afraid of the people living in the land — we’ll eat them up! Their defense has been taken away from them, and Adonai is with us! Don’t be afraid of them!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"><text:soft-page-break/>But just as the whole community were saying they should be stoned to death, the glory of Adonai appeared in the tent of meeting to all the people of Isra’el. Adonai said to Moshe, “How much longer is this people going to treat me with contempt? How much longer will they not trust me, especially considering all the signs I have performed among them? I am going to strike them with sickness, destroy them and make from you a nation greater and stronger than they are!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">However, Moshe replied to Adonai, “When the Egyptians hear about this — [and they will,] because it was from among them that you, by your strength, brought this people up — they will tell the people living in this land. They have heard that you, Adonai, are with this people; that you, Adonai, are seen face to face; that your cloud stands over them; that you go ahead of them in a column of cloud by day and a column of fire by night. If you kill off this people at a single stroke, then the nations that have heard of your reputation will say that the reason Adonai slaughtered this people in the desert is that he wasn’t able to bring them into the land which he swore to give them. So now, please, let Adonai’s power be as great as when you said, ‘Adonai is slow to anger, rich in grace, forgiving offenses and crimes; yet not exonerating the guilty, but causing the negative effects of the parents’ offenses to be experienced by their children and even by the third and fourth generations.’ Please! Forgive the offense of this people according to the greatness of your grace, just as you have borne with this people from Egypt until now.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">Adonai answered, “I have forgiven, as you have asked. But as sure as I live, and that the whole earth is filled with the glory of Adonai, none of the people who saw my glory and the signs I did in Egypt and in the desert, yet tested me these ten times and did not listen to my voice, will see the land I swore to their ancestors! None of those who treated me with contempt will see it. But my servant Kalev, because he had a different Spirit with him and has fully followed me — him I will bring into the land he entered, and it will belong to his descendants.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">“Now, since the ‘Amaleki and the Kena‘ani are living in the valley, tomorrow turn around and get yourselves into the desert along the way to the Sea of Suf.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">(iv) Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon, “How long am I to put up with this evil community who keep grumbling about me? I have heard the complaints of the people of Isra’el, which they continue to raise against me. Tell them this: ‘As surely as I live, Adonai swears, as surely as you have spoken in my ears, I will do this to you: your carcasses will fall in this desert! <text:soft-page-break/>Every single one of you who were included in the census over the age of twenty, you who have complained against me, will certainly not enter the land about which I raised my hand to swear that I would have you live in it — except for Kalev the son of Y’funeh and Y’hoshua the son of Nun. But your little ones, who you said would be taken as booty — them I will bring in. They will know the land you have rejected. But you, your carcasses will fall in this desert; and your children will wander about in the desert for forty years bearing the consequences of your prostitutions until the desert eats up your carcasses. It will be a year for every day you spent reconnoitering the land that you will bear the consequences of your offenses — forty days, forty years. Then you will know what it means to oppose me! I, Adonai, have spoken.’ I will certainly do this to this whole evil community who have assembled together against me — they will be destroyed in this desert and die there.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">The men whom Moshe had sent to reconnoiter the land and who, when they returned, made the entire community complain against him by giving an unfavorable report about the land — those men who gave the unfavorable report about the land died by the plague in the presence of Adonai. Of the men who went to reconnoiter the land, only Y’hoshua the son of Nun and Kalev the son of Y’funeh remained alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">When Moshe told these things to all the people of Isra’el, the people felt great remorse. They arose early the next morning, came up to the top of the mountain and said, “Here we are, and we did sin, but now we’ll go up to the place Adonai promised.” Moshe answered, “Why are you opposing what Adonai said? You won’t succeed! Don’t go up there, because Adonai isn’t with you. If you do, your enemies will defeat you. The ‘Amalekim and the Kena‘anim are there ahead of you, and you will be struck down by the sword. The reason will be that you have turned away from following Adonai, so that Adonai won’t be with you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80">But they were presumptuous and went on up toward the high parts of the hill-country, even though the ark for the covenant of Adonai — and Moshe — stayed in the camp. So the ‘Amalekim and the Kena‘anim living in that hill-country descended, struck them down and beat them back all the way to Hormah.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Tell the people of Isra’el, ‘When you have come into the land where you are going to live, which I am giving to you, and want to make an offering by fire to Adonai — a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or to be a voluntary offering, or at your designated times, to make a fragrant aroma for Adonai — then, whether it is comes from the <text:soft-page-break/>herd or from the flock, the person bringing the offering is to present Adonai with a grain offering consisting of two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of olive oil, and one quart of wine for the drink offering.

For this community there will be the same law for you as for the foreigner living with you; this is a permanent regulation through all your generations; the foreigner is to be treated the same way before Adonai as yourselves. The same Torah and standard of judgment will apply to both you and the foreigner living with you.’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(vi) Adonai said to Moshe, “Speak to the people of Isra’el; tell them, ‘When you enter the land where I am bringing you and eat bread produced in the land, you are to set aside a portion as a gift for Adonai. Set aside from your first dough a cake as a gift; set it aside as you would set aside a portion of the grain from the threshing-floor.

The cohen is to make atonement for the whole community of the people of Isra’el; and they will be forgiven; because it was a mistake; and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire, to Adonai, and their sin offering before Adonai for their mistake. The whole community of the people of Isra’el will be forgiven, likewise the foreigner staying with them; because for all the people it was a mistake.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">While the people of Isra’el were in the desert, they found a man gathering wood on Shabbat. Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moshe, Aharon and the whole congregation. They kept him in custody, because it had not yet been decided what to do to him. Then Adonai said to Moshe, “This man must be put to death; the entire community is to stone him to death outside the camp.” So the whole community brought him outside the camp and threw stones at him until he died, as Adonai had ordered Moshe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(Maftir) Adonai said to Moshe, “Speak to the people of Isra’el, instructing them to make, through all their generations, tzitziyot on the corners of their garments, and to put with the tzitzit on each corner a blue thread. It is to be a tzitzit for you to look at and thereby remember all of Adonai’s mitzvot and obey them, so that you won’t go around wherever your own heart and eyes lead you to prostitute yourselves; but it will help you remember and obey all my mitzvot and be holy for your God. I am Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to be your God. I am Adonai your God.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_2" text:outline-level="3"><text:soft-page-break/>Numbers 16</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Now Korach the son of Yitz’har, the son of K’hat, the son of Levi, along with Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eli’av, and On, the son of Pelet, descendants of Re’uven, took men and rebelled against Moshe. Siding with them were 250 men of Isra’el, leaders of the community, key members of the council, men of reputation. They assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon and said to them, “You take too much on yourselves! After all, the entire community is holy, every one of them, and Adonai is among them. So why do you lift yourselves up above Adonai’s assembly?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">When Moshe heard this he fell on his face. Then he said to Korach and his whole group, “In the morning, Adonai will show who are his and who is the holy person he will allow to approach him. Yes, he will bring whomever he chooses near to himself. Do this: take censers, Korach and all your group; put fire in them; and put incense in them before Adonai tomorrow. The one whom Adonai chooses will be the one who is holy! It is you, you sons of Levi, who are taking too much on yourselves!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then Moshe said to Korach, “Listen here, you sons of Levi! Is it for you a mere trifle that the God of Isra’el has separated you from the community of Isra’el to bring you close to himself, so that you can do the work in the tabernacle of Adonai and stand before the community serving them? He has brought you close and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you. Now you want the office of cohen too! That’s why you and your group have gathered together against Adonai! After all, what is Aharon that you complain against him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then Moshe sent to summon Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eli’av. But they replied, “We won’t come up! Is it such a mere trifle, bringing us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that now you arrogate to yourself the role of dictator over us? (ii) You haven’t at all brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and you haven’t put us in possession of fields and vineyards. Do you think you can gouge out these men’s eyes and blind them? We won’t come up!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe was very angry and said to Adonai, “Don’t accept their grain offering! I haven’t taken one donkey from them, I’ve done nothing wrong to any of them.” Moshe said to Korach, “You and your group, be there before Adonai tomorrow — you, they and Aharon. Each of you take his fire pan and put incense in it; every one of you, bring before Adonai his fire pan, 250 fire pans, you too, and Aharon — each one his fire pan.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/>Each man took his fire pan, put fire in it, laid incense on it and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting with Moshe and Aharon. Korach assembled all the group who were against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then the glory of Adonai appeared to the whole assembly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(iii) Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon, “Separate yourselves from this assembly; I’m going to destroy them right now!” They fell on their faces and said, “Oh God, God of the spirits of all humankind, if one person sins, are you going to be angry with the entire assembly?” Adonai answered Moshe, “Tell the assembly to move away from the homes of Korach, Datan and Aviram.” Moshe got up and went to Datan and Aviram, and the leaders of Isra’el followed him. There he said to the assembly, “Leave the tents of these wicked men! Don’t touch anything that belongs to them, or you may be swept away in all their sins.” So they moved away from all around the area where Korach, Datan and Aviram lived.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then Datan and Aviram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents with their wives, sons and little ones. Moshe said, “Here is how you will know that Adonai has sent me to do all these things and that I haven’t done them out of my own ambition: if these men die a natural death like other people, only sharing the fate common to all humanity, then Adonai has not sent me. But if Adonai does something new — if the ground opens up and swallows them with everything they own, and they go down alive to Sh’ol — then you will understand that these men have had contempt for Adonai.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">The moment he finished speaking, the ground under them split apart — the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all the people who had sided with Korach and everything they owned. So they and everything they owned went down alive into Sh’ol, the earth closed over them and their existence in the community ceased. All Isra’el around them fled at their shrieks, shouting, “The earth might swallow us too!” Then fire came out from Adonai and destroyed the 250 men who had offered the incense.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai said to Moshe, “Tell El‘azar the son of Aharon the cohen to remove the fire pans from the fire, and scatter the smoldering coals at a distance, because they have become holy. Also the fire pans of these men, whose sin cost them their lives, have become holy, because they were offered before Adonai. Therefore, have them hammered into plates to cover the altar.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/>El‘azar the cohen took the brass fire pans which the men who had been burned to death had offered, and they hammered them into a covering for the altar, to remind the people of Isra’el that an ordinary person, not descended from Aharon, is not to approach and burn incense before Adonai, if he wants to avoid the fate of Korach and his group — as Adonai had said to him through Moshe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But the very next day, the whole community of the people of Isra’el complained against Moshe and Aharon: “You have killed Adonai’s people!” However, as the community was assembling against Moshe and Aharon, they looked in the direction of the tent of meeting and saw the cloud cover it and the glory of Adonai appear. Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the tent of meeting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(iv) Adonai said to Moshe, “Get away from this assembly, and I will destroy them at once!” But they fell on their faces. Moshe said to Aharon, “Take your fire pan, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, and hurry with it to the assembly to make atonement for them, because anger has gone out from Adonai, and the plague has already begun!” Aharon took it, as Moshe had said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. There the plague had already begun among the people, but he added the incense and made atonement for the people. He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped. Those dying from the plague numbered 14,700 — besides those who died in the Korach incident. Aharon returned to Moshe at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.</text:p>

Put them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe spoke to the people of Isra’el, and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their ancestral tribes, twelve staffs.

The next day Moshe went into the tent of the testimony, and there he saw that Aharon’s staff for the house of Levi had budded — it had sprouted not only buds but flowers and ripe almonds as well. Moshe brought out all the staffs from before Adonai to all the people of Isra’el, and they looked, and each man took back his staff.</text:p>

They are to be at your disposal and perform all kinds of tasks related to the tent; only they are not to come near the holy furnishings or the altar, so that neither they nor you will die.

But the firstborn of an ox, sheep or goat you are not to redeem; they are holy — you are to splash their blood against the altar and make their fat go up in smoke as an offering made by fire, as a fragrant aroma for Adonai. Their meat will be yours, like the breast that is waved and the right thigh — they will be yours. All the contributions of holy things which the people of Isra’el offer to Adonai I have given to you, your sons and your daughters with you; this is a perpetual law, an eternal covenant of salt before Adonai for you and your descendants with you.”</text:p>

El‘azar the cohen is to take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle this blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. The heifer is to be burned to ashes before his eyes — its skin, meat, blood and dung is to be burned to ashes. The cohen is to take cedar-wood, hyssop and scarlet yarn and throw them onto the heifer as it is burning up. Then the cohen is to wash his clothes and himself in water, after which he may re-enter the camp; but the cohen will remain unclean until evening.

A man who is clean is to collect the ashes of the heifer and store them outside the camp in a clean place. They are to be kept for the community of the people of Isra’el to prepare water for purification from sin.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Because the community had no water, they assembled themselves against Moshe and Aharon. The people quarreled with Moshe and said, “We wish we had died when our brothers died before Adonai. Why did you bring Adonai’s community into this desert? To die there, we and our livestock? Why did you make us leave Egypt? To bring us to this terrible place without seed, figs, grapevines, pomegranates or even water to drink?” Moshe and Aharon left the assembly, went to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces; and the glory of Adonai appeared to them.</text:p>

But after Moshe <text:soft-page-break/>and Aharon had assembled the community in front of the rock, he said to them, “Listen here, you rebels! Are we supposed to bring you water from this rock?” Then Moshe raised his hand and hit the rock twice with his staff. Water flowed out in abundance, and the community and their livestock drank.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon, “Because you did not trust in me, so as to cause me to be regarded as holy by the people of Isra’el, you will not bring this community into the land I have given them.” This is M’rivah Spring [Disputation Spring], where the people of Isra’el disputed with Adonai, and he was caused to be regarded as holy by them.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(LY: iv) Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: “This is what your brother Isra’el says: you know all the troubles we have gone through — that our ancestors went down into Egypt, we lived in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our ancestors badly. But when we cried out to Adonai, he heard us, sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now here we are in Kadesh, a city at the edge of your territory. Please let us pass through your land. We will not go through fields or vineyards, and we won’t drink any water from the wells.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">But Edom answered, “You are not to pass through my land; if you do, I will come out against you with the sword.” The people of Isra’el replied, “We will keep to the highway; if we do drink the water, either we or our livestock, we will pay for it. Just let us pass through on foot — it’s nothing.” But he said, “You are not to pass through”; and Edom came out against them with many people and much force.

Take Aharon and El‘azar his son, bring them up to Mount Hor, remove the garments from Aharon and put them on El‘azar his son. Aharon will be gathered to his people — he will die there.”</text:p>

Isra’el made a vow to Adonai, “If you will hand this people over to me, I will completely destroy their cities.” Adonai listened to what Isra’el said and handed over the Kena‘anim, so they completely destroyed them and their cities and named the place Hormah [complete destruction].</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81">Then they traveled from Mount Hor on the road toward the Sea of Suf in order to go around the land of Edom; but the people’s tempers grew short because of the detour. The people spoke against God and against Moshe: “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt? To die in the desert? There’s no real food, there’s no water, and we’re sick of this miserable stuff we’re eating!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81">(LY: vi) In response, Adonai sent poisonous snakes among the people; they bit the people, and many of Isra’el’s people died. The people came to Moshe and said, “We sinned by speaking against Adonai and against you. Pray to Adonai that he rid us of these snakes.” Moshe prayed for the people, and Adonai answered Moshe: “Make a poisonous snake and put it on a pole. When anyone who has been bitten sees it, he will live.” Moshe made a bronze snake and put it on the pole; if a snake had bitten someone, then, when he looked toward the bronze snake, he stayed alive.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81">The people of Isra’el traveled on and camped at Ovot. From Ovot they traveled and camped at ‘Iyei-Ha‘avarim, in the desert fronting Mo’av on the east. From there they traveled and camped in Vadi Zered. From there they traveled and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the desert; this river comes out of the territory of the Emori; for the Arnon is the boundary between Mo’av and the Emori. This is why it says, in the Book of the Wars of Adonai, “. . . Vahev at Sufah, the vadis of Arnon, and the slope of the vadis extending as far as the site of ‘Ar, which lie next to the territory of Mo’av.”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P81">From there they went on to Be’er [well]; that is the well about which Adonai said to Moshe, “Assemble the people, and I will give them water.” Then Isra’el sang this song:</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P81">(RY: iv, LY: vii) Isra’el sent messengers to Sichon, king of the Emori, with this message: “Let me pass through your land. We won’t turn aside into fields or vineyards, and we won’t drink any water from the wells. We will go along the King’s Highway until we have left your territory.” But Sichon would not allow Isra’el to pass through his territory. Instead, Sichon mustered all his people and went out into the desert to fight Isra’el. On reaching Yachatz, he fought Isra’el. Isra’el defeated him by force of arms and took control of his land from the Arnon to the Yabok River, but only as far as the people of ‘Amon, because the territory of the people of ‘Amon was well defended. Isra’el took all these cities — Isra’el lived in all the cities of the Emori, in Heshbon and all its surrounding towns. Heshbon was the city of Sichon, the king of the Emori, who had fought against the former king of Mo’av and conquered all his land up to the Arnon. This is why the storytellers say,</text:p>

(LY: Maftir) Adonai said to Moshe, “Don’t be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with all his people and his land. You will treat him just as you did Sichon, king of the Emori, who lived at Heshbon.” So they struck him down, with his sons and all his people, until there was no one left alive; and then they took control of his land.</text:p>

Now Balak the son of Tzippor saw all that Isra’el had done to the Emori. Mo’av was very afraid of the people, because there were so many of them; Mo’av was overcome with dread because of the people of Isra’el. So Mo’av said to the leaders of Midyan, “This horde will lick up everything around us, the way an ox licks up grass in the field.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Balak the son of Tzippor was king of Mo’av at that time.

Therefore, please come, and curse this people for me, because they are stronger than I am. Maybe I will be able to strike them down and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is in fact blessed, and whomever you curse is in fact cursed.” The leaders of Mo’av and Midyan left, taking with them the payment for divining, came to Bil‘am and spoke to him the words of Balak. He said to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring you back whatever answer Adonai tells me.” So the princes of Mo’av stayed with Bil‘am.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Balak again sent princes, more of them and of higher status than the first group.

I will reward you very well, and whatever you say to me I will do. So please come, and curse this people for me.’” Bil‘am answered the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Adonai my God to do anything, great or small. Now, please, you too, stay here tonight; so that I may find out what else Adonai will say to me.” God came to Bil‘am during the night and said to him, “If the men have come to summon you, get up and go with them; but do only what I tell you.”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(LY: iii) So Bil‘am got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Mo’av. But God’s anger flared up because he went, and the angel of Adonai stationed himself on the path to bar his way. He was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. The donkey saw the angel of Adonai standing on the road, drawn sword in hand; so the donkey turned off the road into the field; and Bil‘am had to beat the donkey to get it back on the road. Then the angel of Adonai stood on the road where it became narrow as it passed among the vineyards and had stone walls on both sides. The donkey saw the angel of Adonai and pushed up against the wall, crushing Bil‘am’s foot against the wall. So he beat it again. The angel of Adonai moved ahead and stood in a place so tight that there was no room to turn either right or left. Again the donkey saw the angel of Adonai and lay down under Bil‘am, which made him so angry that he hit the donkey with his stick. But Adonai enabled the donkey to speak, and it said to Bil‘am, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?” Bil‘am said to the donkey, “It’s because you’ve been making a fool of me! I wish I had a sword in my hand; I would kill you on the spot!” The donkey said to Bil‘am, “I’m your donkey, right? You’ve ridden me all your life, right? Have I ever treated you like this before?” “No,” he admitted. Then Adonai opened Bil‘am’s eyes, so that he could see <text:soft-page-break/>the angel of Adonai standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, and he bowed his head and fell on his face. The angel of Adonai said to him, “Why did you hit your donkey three times like that? I have come out here to bar your way, because you are rushing to oppose me. The donkey saw me and turned aside these three times; and indeed, if she hadn’t turned away from me, I would have killed you by now and saved it alive!” Bil‘am said to the angel of Adonai, “I have sinned. I didn’t know that you were standing on the road to block me. Now, therefore, if what I am doing displeases you, I will go back.” But the angel of Adonai said to Bil‘am, “No, go on with the men; but you are to say only what I tell you to say.” So Bil‘am went along with the princes of Balak.</text:p>

Now you, another brood of sinners, have arisen in your fathers’ place to increase still more the fierce anger of Adonai toward Isra’el!

They are to have the cities to live in, while their open land will be for their livestock, for growing crops and for all their animals. The open land around the cities you give to the L’vi’im is to commence at a line drawn around the city wall 1,500 feet outside it and is to extend outward from there.

These cities are to be a refuge for you from the dead person’s next-of-kin, who might otherwise avenge his kinsman’s death by slaying the killer prior to his standing trial before the community. In regard to the cities you are to give, there are to be six cities of refuge for you. You are to give three cities east of the Yarden and three cities in the land of Kena‘an; they will be cities of refuge.

Or if he hits him with a wood utensil in his hand capable of killing someone, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death. The next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death himself — upon meeting him, he is to put him to death. Likewise, if he shoves him out of hatred; or intentionally throws something at him, causing his death; or out of hostility strikes him with his hand, so that he dies; then the one who struck him must be put to death; he is a murderer; and the next-of-kin avenger is to put the murderer to death upon meeting him.</text:p>

The community is to return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he is to live there until the cohen hagadol, who was anointed with the holy oil, dies. But if the killer ever goes beyond the limits of the city of refuge he fled to, and the next-of-kin avenger finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger kills the killer, he will not be guilty of the man’s blood; because he must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the cohen hagadol.

Likewise, you are not to accept for someone who has fled to his city of refuge a ransom that would allow him to return to his land before the death of the cohen. In this way you will not defile the land in which you are living. For blood defiles the land, and in this land no atonement can be made for the blood shed in it except the blood of him who shed it.

They said, <text:soft-page-break/>“Adonai ordered my lord to give by lot the land to be inherited by the people of Isra’el, and my lord was ordered by Adonai to give the inheritance of our kinsman Tz’lof’chad to his daughters.

In this way no inheritance of the people of Isra’el will move from one tribe to another; for each of the people of Isra’el is to hold on to the land for inheritance belonging to his father’s tribe. Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Isra’el is to become the wife of someone from the family of her father’s tribe, so that every one of the people of Isra’el will stay in possession of his ancestors’ inheritance.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, Moshe spoke to the people of Isra’el, reviewing everything Adonai had ordered him to tell them. This was after he had defeated Sichon, king of the Emori, who lived in Heshbon, and ‘Og, king of Bashan, who lived in ‘Ashtarot, at Edre‘i. There, beyond the Yarden, in the land of Mo’av, Moshe took it upon himself to expound this Torah and said:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Adonai spoke to us in Horev. He said, ‘You have lived long enough by this mountain. Turn, get moving and go to the hill-country of the Emori and all the places near there in the ‘Aravah, the hill-country, the Sh’felah, the Negev and by the seashore — the land of the Kena‘ani, and the L’vanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates River. I have set the land before you! Go in, and take possession of the land Adonai swore to give to your ancestors Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov, and their descendants after them.’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“At that time I told you, ‘You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. Adonai your God has multiplied your numbers, so that there are as many of you today as there are stars in the sky. May Adonai, the God of your ancestors, increase you yet a thousandfold and bless you, as he has promised you! (ii) But you are burdensome, bothersome and quarrelsome! How can I bear it by myself alone? Pick for yourselves from each of your tribes men who are wise, understanding and knowledgeable; and I will make them heads over you.’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“You answered me, ‘What you have said would be a good thing for us to do.’ So I took the heads of your tribes, men wise and knowledgable, and made them heads over you — leaders in charge of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe. At that time I commissioned your judges, ‘Hear the cases that arise between your brothers; and judge fairly between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is with him. You are not to show favoritism when judging, but give equal attention to the small and to the great. No matter how a person presents himself, don’t be afraid of him; because the decision is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, bring to me and I will hear it.’ I also gave you orders at that time concerning all the things you were to do.</text:p>

There I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill-country of the Emori, which Adonai our God is giving to us. Look! Adonai your God has placed the land before you. Go up, take <text:soft-page-break/>possession, as Adonai, the God of your ancestors, has told you. Don’t be afraid, don’t be dismayed.’</text:p>

They took some of the produce of the land and brought it down to us; they also brought back word to us — ‘The land Adonai our God is giving to us is good.’</text:p>

What sort of place is it that we’re heading for? Our brothers made our courage fail when they said, “The people are bigger and taller than we are; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and finally, we have seen ‘Anakim there.”’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“I answered you, ‘Don’t be fearful, don’t be afraid of them. Adonai your God, who is going ahead of you, will fight on your behalf, just as he accomplished all those things for you in Egypt before your eyes, and likewise in the desert, where you saw how Adonai your God carried you, like a man carries his child, along the entire way you traveled until you arrived at this place. Yet in this matter you don’t trust Adonai your God, even though he went ahead of you, seeking out places for you to pitch your tents and showing you which way to go, by fire at night and by a cloud during the day.’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Adonai heard what you were saying, became angry and swore, ‘Not a single one of these people, this whole evil generation, will see the good land I swore to give to your ancestors, except Kalev the son of Y’funeh — he will see it; I will give him and his descendants the land he walked on, because he has fully followed Adonai.’</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Also, because of you Adonai was angry with me and said, ‘You too will not go in there. Y’hoshua the son of Nun, your assistant — he will go in there. So encourage him, because he will enable Isra’el to take possession of it. (iv) Moreover, your little ones, who you said would be taken as booty, and your children who don’t yet know good from bad — they will go in there; I will give it to them, and they will have possession of it.

But Adonai said to me, ‘Tell them, “Don’t go up, and don’t fight, because I am not there with you; if you do, your enemies will defeat you.”’ So I told you, but you wouldn’t listen. Instead, you rebelled against Adonai’s order, took matters into your own hands and went up into the hill-country; where the Emori living in that hill-country came out against you like bees, defeated you in Se‘ir and chased you back all the way to Hormah. You returned and cried before Adonai, but Adonai neither listened to what you said nor paid you any attention. This is why you had to stay in Kadesh as long as you did.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Then we turned and began traveling into the desert along the road to the Sea of Suf, as Adonai had said to me; and we skirted Mount Se‘ir for a long time. (v) Finally Adonai said to me, ‘You have been going around this mountain long enough! Head north, and give this order to the people: “You are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the descendants of ‘Esav who live in Se‘ir. They will be afraid of you, so be very cautious, and don’t get into disputes with them; for I am not going to give you any of their land, no, not even enough for one foot to stand on; inasmuch as I have given Mount Se‘ir to ‘Esav as his possession. Pay them money for the food you eat, and pay them money for the water you drink. For Adonai your God has blessed you in everything your hands have produced. He knows that you have been traveling through this vast desert; these forty years Adonai your God has been with you; and you have lacked nothing.’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“So we went on past our kinsmen the descendants of ‘Esav living in Se‘ir, left the road through the ‘Aravah from Eilat and ‘Etzyon-Gever, and turned to pass along the road through the desert of Mo’av. Adonai said to me, ‘Don’t be hostile toward Mo’av or fight with them, because I will not give you any of their land to possess, since I have already given ‘Ar to the descendants of Lot as their territory.’” (The Emim used to live there, a great and numerous people as tall as the ‘Anakim. They are also considered Refa’im, as are the ‘Anakim, but the Mo’avim call them Emim. In Se‘ir the Horim used to live, but the descendants of ‘Esav dispossessed and destroyed them, settling in their place. Isra’el did similarly in the land it came to possess, which Adonai gave to them.) “‘Now get going, and cross Vadi Zered!’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"><text:soft-page-break/>“So we crossed Vadi Zered. The time between our leaving Kadesh-Barnea and our crossing Vadi Zered was thirty-eight years — until the whole generation of men capable of bearing arms had been eliminated from the camp, as Adonai had sworn they would be. Moreover, Adonai’s hand was against them to root them out of the camp until the last of them was gone. When all the men who were able to bear arms had died and were no longer part of the people, Adonai said to me, ‘Today you are to cross the border of Mo’av at ‘Ar. When you approach the descendants of ‘Amon, don’t bother them or fight with them, for I will not give you any of the territory of the people of ‘Amon to possess, since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their territory.’”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(This too is considered a land of the Refa’im: Refa’im, whom the Emori call Zamzumim, used to live there. They were a large, numerous people, as tall as the ‘Anakim; but Adonai destroyed them as the people of ‘Amon advanced and settled in their place — just as he destroyed the Horim as descendants of ‘Esav advanced into Se‘ir and settled in their place, where they live to this day. It was the same with the ‘Avim, who lived in villages as far away as ‘Azah — the Kaftorim, coming from Kaftor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“‘Get up, get moving, and cross the Arnon Valley!

   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“I sent envoys from the K’demot Desert to Sichon king of Heshbon with a peaceable message, ‘Let me pass through your land.

Do as the people of ‘Esav living in Se‘ir and the Mo’avim living in ‘Ar did with me, until I cross the Yarden into the land Adonai our God is giving us.’</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“But Sichon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through his territory, because Adonai your God had hardened his spirit and made him stubborn, so that he could hand him over to you, as is the case today. (vi) Adonai said to me, ‘See, I have begun handing over Sichon and his territory before you; start taking possession of his land.’ Then Sichon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Yahatz; and Adonai our God handed him over to us, so that we defeated him, his sons and all his people.

At that time we captured all his cities; there was not one city of theirs that we didn’t capture. There were sixty cities, all the region of Argov, the kingdom of ‘Og in Bashan; all of them fortified cities with high walls, gates and bars — in addition to a great number of unwalled towns.

His bed was made of iron; it is still in Rabbah with the people of ‘Amon. It was nine cubits long and four cubits wide, using the normal cubit [thirteen-and-a-half by six feet].</text:p>

Please!

Adonai said to me, ‘Enough from you! Don’t say another word to me about this matter! Climb up to the top of Pisgah and look out to the west, north, south and east. Look with your eyes — but you will not go across this Yarden. However, commission Y’hoshua, encourage him and strengthen him; for he will lead this people across and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’ So we stayed in the valley across from Beit-P‘or.</text:p>

In order to obey the mitzvot of Adonai your God which I am giving you, do not add to what I am saying, and do not subtract from it. You saw with your own eyes what Adonai did at Ba‘al-P‘or, that Adonai destroyed from among you all the men who <text:soft-page-break/>followed Ba‘al-P‘or; but you who stuck with Adonai your God are still alive today, every one of you. (ii) Look, I have taught you laws and rulings, just as Adonai my God ordered me, so that you can behave accordingly in the land where you are going in order to take possession of it. Therefore, observe them; and follow them; for then all peoples will see you as having wisdom and understanding. When they hear of all these laws, they will say, ‘This great nation is surely a wise and understanding people.’ For what great nation is there that has God as close to them as Adonai our God is, whenever we call on him? What great nation is there that has laws and rulings as just as this entire Torah which I am setting before you today? Only be careful, and watch yourselves diligently as long as you live, so that you won’t forget what you saw with your own eyes, so that these things won’t vanish from your hearts. Rather, make them known to your children and grandchildren — the day you stood before Adonai your God at Horev, when Adonai said to me, ‘Gather the people to me, and I will make them hear my very words, so that they will learn to hold me in awe as long as they live on earth, and so that they will teach their children.’ You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain; and the mountain blazed with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick mist. Then Adonai spoke to you out of the fire! You heard the sound of words but saw no shape, there was only a voice. He proclaimed his covenant to you, which he ordered you to obey, the Ten Words; and he wrote them on two stone tablets. At that time Adonai ordered me to teach you laws and rulings, so that you would live by them in the land you are entering in order to take possession of it.</text:p>

For the same reason, do not look up at the sky, at the sun, moon, stars and everything in the sky, and be drawn away to worship and serve them; Adonai your God has allotted these to all the peoples under the entire sky. No, you Adonai has taken and brought out of the smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of inheritance for him, as you are today.</text:p>

Watch out for yourselves, so that you won’t forget the covenant of Adonai <text:soft-page-break/>your God, which he made with you, and make yourself a carved image, a representation of anything forbidden to you by Adonai your God.

You will not prolong your days there but will be completely destroyed. Adonai will scatter you among the peoples; and among the nations to which Adonai will lead you away, you will be left few in number. There you will serve gods which are the product of human hands, made of wood and stone, which can’t see, hear, eat or smell. However, from there you will seek Adonai your God; and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and being. In your distress, when all these things have come upon you, in the acharit-hayamim, you will return to Adonai your God and listen to what he says; for Adonai your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you, destroy you, or forget the covenant with your ancestors which he swore to them.</text:p>

Or has God ever tried to go and take for himself a nation from the very bowels of another nation, by means of ordeals, signs, wonders, war, a mighty hand, an outstretched arm and great terrors — like all that Adonai your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? This was shown to you, so that you would know that Adonai is God, and there is no other beside him. From heaven he caused you to hear his voice, in order to instruct you; and on earth he caused you to see his great fire; and you heard his very words coming out from the fire. Because he loved your ancestors, chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt with his presence and great power, in order to drive out ahead of you nations greater and stronger than you, so that he could bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as is the case today; know today, and establish it in your heart, that Adonai is God in heaven above and on earth below — there is no other. Therefore, you are to keep his laws and mitzvot which I am giving you today, so that it will go well with you and with your children after you, and so that you will prolong your days in the land Adonai your God is giving you forever.”</text:p>

You will perish just like the nations that Adonai is causing to perish ahead of you, because you will not have heeded the voice of Adonai your God.”</text:p>

From the day you left the land of Egypt till you arrived at this place, you have been rebelling against Adonai. Also in Horev you made Adonai angry — Adonai was angry enough with you to destroy you! I had gone up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets on which was written the covenant Adonai had made with you. I stayed on the mountain forty days and nights without eating food or drinking water. Then Adonai gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God; and on them was written every word Adonai had said to you from the fire on the mountain the day of the assembly. Yes, after forty days and nights Adonai gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. Then Adonai said to me, ‘Get up, and hurry down from here, because your people, whom you led out of Egypt, have become corrupt. So quickly have they turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow! They have made themselves a metal image!’ Moreover, Adonai said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and what a stiffnecked people they are! Let me alone, so that I can put an end to them and blot out their name from under heaven! I will make out of you a nation bigger and stronger than they.’ I came down from the mountain. The mountain was blazing fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. I looked, and there, you had sinned against Adonai your God! You had made yourselves a metal calf, you had turned aside quickly from the way Adonai had ordered you to follow. I seized the two tablets, threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes. Then I fell down <text:soft-page-break/>before Adonai, as I had the first time, for forty days and nights, during which time I neither ate food nor drank water, all because of the sin you committed by doing what was evil in the sight of Adonai and thus provoking him. I was terrified that because of how angry Adonai was at you, of how heatedly displeased he was, that he would destroy you. But Adonai listened to me that time too. In addition, Adonai was very angry with Aharon and would have destroyed him; but I prayed for Aharon also at the same time. I took your sin, the calf you had made, and burned it up in the fire, beat it to pieces, and ground it up still smaller, until it was as fine as dust; then I threw its dust into the stream coming down from the mountain.</text:p>

Remember your servants Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov! Don’t focus on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or on their sin. Otherwise, the land you brought us out of will say, “It is because Adonai wasn’t able to bring them into the land he promised them and because he hated them that he has brought them out to kill them in the desert.” But in fact they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.’</text:p>

He inscribed the tablets with the same inscription as before, the Ten Words which Adonai proclaimed to you from the fire on the mountain the day of the assembly; and Adonai gave them to me.

Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will be without pity for his brother, his beloved wife or his surviving children, to the degree that he will refuse to share with any of them the flesh of his children whom he is eating; because if he did, he would have nothing left for himself — in the severity of the siege and distress your enemies are inflicting on you in all your towns. The most delicate and sensitive woman among you, so sensitive and delicate that she wouldn’t think of touching the sole of her foot to the ground, will so begrudge her own beloved husband, son and daughter that she will <text:soft-page-break/>secretly eat the afterbirth that comes out of her and even her own children as she bears them — so desperately hungry will she be in the severity of the siege and distress your enemies are inflicting on you in your towns.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“If you will not observe and obey all the words of this Torah that are written in this book, so that you will fear this glorious and awesome name, Adonai your God; then Adonai will strike down you and your descendants with extraordinary plagues and severe sicknesses that go on and on. He will bring back upon you all the diseases the Egyptians had, which you were in dread of; and they will cling to you. Not only that, but Adonai will bring upon you all the sicknesses and plagues that are not written in this book of the Torah — until you are destroyed. You will be left few in number, whereas you were once as numerous as the stars in the sky — because you did not pay attention to the voice of Adonai your God.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Thus it will come about that just as once Adonai took joy in seeking to do you good and increase your numbers, so now Adonai will take joy in causing you to perish and be destroyed, and you will be plucked off the land you are entering in order to take possession of it. Adonai will scatter you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will serve other gods, made of wood and stone, which neither you nor your ancestors have known. Among these nations you will not find repose, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; rather Adonai will give you there anguish of heart, dimness of eyes and apathy of spirit. Your life will hang in doubt before you; you will be afraid night and day and have no assurance that you will stay alive. In the morning you will say, ‘Oh, how I wish it were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘Oh, how I wish it were morning!’ — because of the fear overwhelming your heart and the sights your eyes will see. Finally, Adonai will bring you back in ships to Egypt, the place of which I said to you, ‘You will never ever see it again’; and there you will try to sell yourselves as slaves to your enemies, but no one will buy you.”</text:p>

Nevertheless, to this day Adonai has not given you a heart to understand, eyes to see or ears <text:soft-page-break/>to hear! I led you forty years in the desert. Neither the clothes on your body nor the shoes on your feet wore out. You didn’t eat bread, and you didn’t drink wine or other intoxicating liquor; this was so that you would know that ‘I am Adonai your God.’ (Maftir) When you arrived at this place, Sichon the king of Heshbon and ‘Og the king of Bashan advanced against us in battle, and we defeated them, took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Re’uveni, the Gadi and the M’nashi. Therefore, observe the words of this covenant and obey them; so that you can make everything you do prosper.</text:p>

The purpose is that you should enter into the covenant of Adonai your God and into his oath which Adonai your God is making with you today, (LY: ii) so that he can establish you today for himself as a people, and so that for you he will be God — as he said to you and as he swore to your ancestors, to Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov.</text:p>

So let there not be among you a man, woman, family or tribe whose heart turns away today from Adonai our God to go and serve the gods of those nations. Let there not be among you a root bearing such bitter poison and wormwood. If there is such a person, when he hears the words of this curse, he will bless himself secretly, saying to himself, ‘I will be all right, even though I will stubbornly keep doing whatever I feel like doing; so that I, although “dry,” [sinful,] will be added to the “watered” [righteous].’ But Adonai will not forgive him. Rather, the anger and jealousy of Adonai will blaze up against that person. Every curse written in this book will be <text:soft-page-break/>upon him. Adonai will blot out his name from under heaven. Adonai will single him out from all the tribes of Isra’el to experience what is bad in all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the Torah.</text:p>

What is the meaning of such frenzied, furious anger?’ People will answer, ‘It’s because they abandoned the covenant of Adonai, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went and served other gods, prostrating themselves before them, gods they had not known and which he had not assigned them. For this reason, the anger of Adonai blazed up against this land and brought upon it every curse written in this book; and Adonai, in anger, fury and incensed with indignation, uprooted them from their land and threw them out into another land — as it is today.’</text:p>

At that point, Adonai your God will reverse your exile and show you mercy; he will return and gather you from all the peoples to which Adonai your God scattered you. If one of yours was scattered to the far end of the sky, Adonai your God will gather you even from there; he will go there and get you.

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Moshe went and spoke the following words to all Isra’el: “I am 120 years old today. I can’t get around any longer; moreover, Adonai has said to me, ‘You will not cross this Yarden.’ Adonai your God — he will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations ahead of you, and you will dispossess them. Y’hoshua — he will cross over ahead of you, as Adonai has said. (LY: ii) Adonai will do to them what he did to Sichon and ‘Og, the kings of the Emori, <text:soft-page-break/>and to their land — he destroyed them. Adonai will defeat them ahead of you, and you are to do to them just as I have ordered you to do. Be strong, be bold, don’t be afraid or frightened of them, for Adonai your God is going with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(RY: v, LY: iii) Next Moshe summoned Y’hoshua and, in the sight of all Isra’el, said to him, “Be strong, be bold, for you are going with this people into the land Adonai swore to their ancestors he would give them. You will be the one causing them to inherit it. But Adonai — it is he who will go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you, so don’t be afraid or downhearted.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Then Moshe wrote down this Torah and gave it to the cohanim, the descendants of Levi who carried the ark with the covenant of Adonai, and to all the leaders of Isra’el. (LY: iv) Moshe gave them these orders: “At the end of every seven years, during the festival of Sukkot in the year of sh’mittah, when all Isra’el have come to appear in the presence of Adonai at the place he will choose, you are to read this Torah before all Isra’el, so that they can hear it. Assemble the people — the men, the women, the little ones and the foreigners you have in your towns — so that they can hear, learn, fear Adonai your God and take care to obey all the words of this Torah; and so that their children, who have not known, can hear and learn to fear Adonai your God, for as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Yarden to possess.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">(RY: vi, LY: v) Adonai said to Moshe, “The time is coming for you to die. Summon Y’hoshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, so that I can commission him.” Moshe and Y’hoshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting. Adonai appeared in the tent in a column of cloud; the column of cloud stood above the entrance to the tent. Adonai said to Moshe, “You are about to sleep with your ancestors. But this people will get up and offer themselves as prostitutes to the foreign gods of the land where they are going. When they are with those gods, they will abandon me and break my covenant which I have made with them. Then my anger will flare up, and I will abandon them and hide my face from them. They will be devoured, and many calamities and troubles will come upon them. Then they will ask, ‘Haven’t these calamities come upon us because our God isn’t here with us?’ But I will be hiding my face from them because of all the evil they will have done in turning to other gods.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="normal">“Therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the people of Isra’el.

For I know how they think even now, even before I have brought them into the land about which I swore.” So Moshe wrote this song that same day and taught it to the people of Isra’el.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="normal">Adonai also commissioned Y’hoshua the son of Nun with these words: “Be strong and full of courage; for you are to bring the people of Isra’el into the land about which I swore to them; and I will be with you.”</text:p>

For I know how rebellious and stiffnecked you are! Here, even while I am still alive with you today, you have rebelled against Adonai; so how much more will you do so after my death? (Maftir) Assemble for me all the leaders of your tribes and your officials, so that I can say these things in their hearing, calling heaven and earth to witness against them — because I know that after my death you will become very corrupt and turn aside from the way that I have ordered you, and that disaster will come upon you in the acharit-hayamim, because you will do what Adonai sees as evil and provoke him by your deeds.”</text:p>

On the mountain you are ascending you will die and be gathered to your people, just as Aharon your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. The reason for this is that both of you broke faith with me there among the people of Isra’el at the M’rivat-Kadesh Spring, in the Tzin Desert; you failed to demonstrate my holiness there among the people of Isra’el. So you will see the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Isra’el.”</text:p>
